  \class QList qlist.h
  \brief The QList class is a template class that provides doubly linked lists.

  \ingroup collection
  \ingroup tools

  In Qt 2.0 QList is only implemented as a template class. Define a
  template instance QList\<X\> to create a list that operates on pointers
  to X, or X*.

  Example:
  \code
    #include <qlist.h>
    #include <qstring.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    class Employee
    {
    public:
        Employee( const QString& name, int salary ) { n=name; s=salary; }
        QString     name()   const		 { return n; }
        int	    salary() const		 { return s; }
    private:
        QString     n;
        int         s;
    };

    void main()
    {
	QList<Employee> list;		// list of pointers to Employee
	list.setAutoDelete( TRUE );	// delete items when they are removed

	list.append( new Employee("Bill", 50000) );
	list.append( new Employee("Steve",80000) );
	list.append( new Employee("Ron",  60000) );

	Employee *emp;
	for ( emp=list.first(); emp != 0; emp=list.next() )
	    printf( "%s earns %d\n", emp->name().latin1(), emp->salary() );
    }
  \endcode

  Program output:
  \code
	Bill earns 50000
	Steve earns 80000
	Ron earns 60000
  \endcode

  The list class is indexable and has a \link at() current index\endlink
  and a \link current() current item\endlink.  The first item corresponds
  to index 0.  The current index is -1 if the current item is null.

  QList has several member functions for traversing the list, but using
  a QListIterator can be more practical. Multiple list iterators may
  traverse the same list, independent of each other and independent of
  the current list item.

  In the example above, we make the call setAutoDelete(TRUE).
  Enabling auto-deletion tells the list to delete items that are removed
  from the list.  The default is to not delete items when they are
  removed, but that would cause a memory leak in our example since we have
  no other references to the list items.

  List items are stored as \c void* in an internal QLNode, which also
  holds pointers to the next and previous list items.  The functions
  currentNode(), removeNode() and takeNode() operate directly on the
  QLNode, but they should be used with care.

  When inserting an item into a list, only the pointer is copied, not the
  item itself. This is called a shallow copy. It is possible to make the
  list copy all of the item's data (known as a deep copy) when an item is
  inserted.  insert(), inSort() and append() call the virtual function
  QCollection::newItem() for the item to be inserted.
  Inherit a list and reimplement it if you want deep copies.

  When removing an item from a list, the virtual function
  QCollection::deleteItem() is called.  QList's default implementation
  is to delete the item if auto-deletion is enabled.

  The virtual function QGList::compareItems() can be reimplemented to
  compare two list items. This function is called from all list functions
  that need to compare list items, for instance remove(const type*).
  If you only want to deal with pointers, there are functions that
  compare pointers instead, for instance removeRef(const type*).
  These functions are somewhat faster than those that call compareItems().

  The QStrList class in qstrlist.h is a list of \c char*.  QStrList is
  a good example of a list that reimplements newItem(), deleteItem() and
  compareItems()

*/

/*!

/*!
  \fn void QList::sort()

  Sorts the list by the result of the virtual compareItems() function.

  The Heap-Sort algorithm is used for sorting.  It sorts n items with
  O(n*log n) compares.  This is the asymptotic optimal solution of the
  sorting problem.

  If the items in your list support operator< and operator== then you
  might be better off with QSortedList since it implements the
  compareItems() function for you using these two operators.

  Returns TRUE if the list is empty, i.e. count() == 0. Returns FALSE
   otherwise.

/*!
  \fn bool QList::insert( uint index, const type *item )
  Inserts the \e item at the position \e index in the list.

  Returns TRUE if successful, or FALSE if \e index is out of range.
  The valid range is <code>0 .. count()</code> inclusive.
  The item is appended if \e index == count().

  The inserted item becomes the current list item.

  The \e item must not be a null pointer.

  \sa append(), current()
*/

/*!
  \fn void QList::inSort( const type *item )
  Inserts the \e item at its sorted position in the list.

  The sort order depends on the virtual QGList::compareItems() function.
  All items must be inserted with inSort() to maintain the sorting order.

  The inserted item becomes the current list item.

  The \e item must not be a null pointer.

  Please note that inSort is slow. If you want to insert lots of items
  in a list and sort after inserting then you should use sort().
  inSort() takes up to O(n) compares. That means inserting n items in
  your list will need O(n^2) compares while sort() only needs O(n*logn)
  for the same task. So you inSort() only if you already have a pre-sorted
  list and want to insert only few additional items.

  \sa insert(), QGList::compareItems(), current(), sort()
*/

/*!
  \fn void QList::append( const type *item )
  Inserts the \e item at the end of the list.

  The inserted item becomes the current list item.
  This is equivalent to \c insert(count(),item).


  The \e item must not be a null pointer.

  \sa insert(), current(), prepend()
*/

/*!
  \fn void QList::prepend( const type *item )

  Inserts the \e item at the start of the list.

  The inserted item becomes the current list item.
  This is equivalent to \c insert(0,item).

  The \e item must not be a null pointer.

  \sa append(), insert(), current()

/*!
  \fn bool QList::remove( uint index )
  Removes the item at position \e index in the list.

  Returns TRUE if successful, or FALSE if \e index is out of range.
  The valid range is <code>0 .. (count() - 1)</code> inclusive.

  The removed item is deleted if \link QCollection::setAutoDelete()
  auto-deletion\endlink is enabled.

  The item after the removed item becomes the new current list item if
  the removed item is not the last item in the list.  If the last item
  is removed, the new last item becomes the current item in Qt 2.x.
  In 3.0, the current item will be set to null.  The current item is
  set to null if the list becomes empty.

  Although QList has member functions to traverse the doubly linked list
  structure, using a list iterator is a much more robust way of traversing
  the list, because multiple list iterators can operate on the same list,
  independent of each other and independent of the QList's current item.
  An iterator has its own current list item and can get the next and
  previous list items.  It can only traverse the list, never modify it.

  A QList knows about all list iterators that are operating on the list.
  When an item is removed from the list, the list update all iterators
  that are pointing the removed item to point to the new current list item.

  Example:
  \code
    #include <qlist.h>
    #include <qstring.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    class Employee
    {
	...	// same as above
    };

    void main()
    {
	QList<Employee> list;		  // list of pointers to Employee
	list.setAutoDelete( TRUE );	  // delete items when they are removed

	list.append( new Employee("Bill", 50000) );
	list.append( new Employee("Steve",80000) );
	list.append( new Employee("Ron",  60000) );

	QListIterator<Employee> it(list);

	list.at( 1 );			  // current list item: "Steve"
        it.toLast();			  // it: "Ron"
	--it;				  // it: "Steve"

	  // Now, both the list and the iterator are referring the same item

	list.remove();
	printf( "%s\n", it.current()->name().latin1() );
    }

/*!
  \class QStrList qstrlist.h
  \brief The QStrList class provides a doubly linked list of \c char*.

  \ingroup collection
  \ingroup tools

  This class is a QList\<char\> instance (a list of char*).

  QStrList can make deep or shallow copies of the strings that are inserted.

  A deep copy means to allocate space for the string and then copy the string
  data into it.  A shallow copy is just a copy of the pointer value and not
  the string data.

  The disadvantage with shallow copies is that since a pointer can only
  be deleted once, the program must put all strings in a central place and
  know when it is safe to delete them (i.e. when the strings are no longer
  referenced by other parts of the program).  This can make the program
  more complex.  The advantage of shallow copies is that shallow copies
  consume far less memory than deep copies.  It is also much faster
  to copy a pointer (typically 4 or 8 bytes) than to copy string data.

  A QStrList that operates on deep copies will by default turn on
  auto-deletion (see setAutoDelete()). Thus, by default, QStrList will
  deallocate any string copies it allocates.

  The virtual compareItems() function is reimplemented and does a case
  sensitive string comparison. The inSort() function will insert
  strings in a sorted order.

  The QStrListIterator class is an iterator for QStrList.

/*!
  \fn QStrList::QStrList( const QStrList &list )
  Constructs a copy of \e list.

  If \e list has deep copies, this list will also get deep copies.

  use deep copies.
