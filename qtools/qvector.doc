  \class QVector qvector.h

  \brief The QVector class is a template collection class that
  provides a vector (array).

  \ingroup tools

  QVector is implemented as a template class. Define a template
  instance QVector\<X\> to create a vector that contains pointers to
  X, or X*.

  A vector is the same as an array. The main difference between
  QVector and QArray is that QVector stores pointers to the elements,
  while QArray stores the elements themselves (i.e. QArray is
  value-based).

  Unless where otherwise stated, all functions that remove items from
  the vector will also delete the element pointed to if auto-deletion
  is enabled - see setAutoDelete(). By default, auto-deletion is
  disabled. This behaviour can be changed in a subclass by
  reimplementing the virtual method deleteItem().

  Functions that compares items, e.g. find() and sort(), will do so
  using the virtual function compareItems(). The default
  implementation of this function will only compare the absolute
  pointer values. Reimplement compareItems() in a subclass to get
  searching and sorting based on the item contents.

/*!
  \fn QVector::QVector()

  Constructs a null vector.

  \sa isNull()
*/

/*!
  \fn QVector::QVector( uint size )

  Constructs an vector with room for \a size items.  Makes a null
  vector if \a size == 0.

  All \a size positions in the vector are initialized to 0.

  \sa size(), resize(), isNull()
*/

/*!
  \fn QVector::QVector( const QVector<type> &v )

  Constructs a copy of \a v. Only the pointers are copied (i.e. shallow copy).
*/

/*!
  \fn QVector::~QVector()

  Removes all items from the vector, and destroys the vector itself.

  \sa clear()
*/

/*!
  \fn QVector<type> &QVector::operator=( const QVector<type> &v )

  Assigns \a v to this vector and returns a reference to this vector.

  This vector is first cleared, then all the items from \a v is copied
  into this vector. Only the pointers are copied (i.e. shallow copy).

  \sa clear()
*/

/*!
  \fn type **QVector::data() const
  Returns a pointer to the actual vector data, which is an array of type*.

  The vector is a null vector if data() == 0 (null pointer).

  \sa isNull()
*/

/*!
  \fn uint QVector::size() const

  Returns the size of the vector, i.e. the number of vector
  positions. This is also the maximum number of items the vector can
  hold.

  The vector is a null vector if size() == 0.

  \sa isNull(), resize(), count()
*/

/*!
  \fn uint QVector::count() const 

  Returns the number of items in the vector. The vector is empty if
  count() == 0.

  \sa isEmpty(), size()
*/

/*!
  \fn bool QVector::isEmpty() const

  Returns TRUE if the vector is empty, i.e. count() == 0, otherwise FALSE.

  \sa count()
*/

/*!
  \fn bool QVector::isNull() const

  Returns TRUE if the vector is null, otherwise FALSE.

  A null vector has size() == 0 and data() == 0.

  \sa size()
*/

/*!
  \fn bool QVector::resize( uint size )
  Resizes (expands or shrinks) the vector to \a size elements. The array
  becomes a null array if \a size == 0.

  Any items in position \a size or beyond in the vector are removed.
  New positions are initialized 0.

  Returns TRUE if successful, or FALSE if the memory cannot be allocated.

  \sa size(), isNull()
*/

/*!
  \fn bool QVector::insert( uint i, const type *d )

  Sets position \a i in the vector to contain the item \a d. \a i must
  be less than size(). Any previous element in position \a i is removed.

  \sa at()
*/

/*!
  \fn bool QVector::remove( uint i )

  Removes the item at position \a i in the vector, if there is one.
  \a i must be less than size().

  Returns TRUE unless \a i is out of range.

  \sa take(), at()
*/

/*!
  \fn type* QVector::take( uint i )

  Returns the item at position \a i in the vector, and removes that
  item from the vector. \a i must be less than size(). If there is no
  item at position \a i, 0 is returned.

  In contrast to remove(), this function does \e not call deleteItem()
  for the removed item.

  \sa remove(), at()
*/

/*!
  \fn void QVector::clear()

  Removes all items from the vector, and destroys the vector
  itself.

  The vector becomes a null vector.

  \sa isNull()
*/

/*!
  \fn bool QVector::fill( const type *d, int size )

  Inserts item \a d in all positions in the vector. Any existing items
  are removed. If \a d is 0, the vector becomes empty.

  If \a size >= 0, the vector is first resized to \a size. By default,
  \a size is -1.

  Returns TRUE if successful, or FALSE if the memory cannot be allocated
  (only if a resize has been requested).

  \sa resize(), insert(), isEmpty()
*/

/*!
  \fn void QVector::sort()

  Sorts the items in ascending order. Any empty positions will be put
  last.

  Compares items using the virtual function compareItems().

  \sa bsearch()
*/

/*!
  \fn int QVector::bsearch( const type* d ) const

  In a sorted array, finds the first occurrence of \a d using binary
  search. For a sorted array, this is generally much faster than
  find(), which does a linear search.

  Returns the position of \a d, or -1 if \a d could not be found. \a d
  may not be 0.

  Compares items using the virtual function compareItems().

  \sa sort(), find()
*/


/*!
  \fn int QVector::findRef( const type *d, uint i ) const

  Finds the first occurrence of the item pointer \a d in the vector,
  using linear search. The search starts at position \a i, which must
  be less than size(). \a i is by default 0; i.e. the search starts at
  the start of the vector.

  Returns the position of \a d, or -1 if \a d could not be found.

  This function does \e not use compareItems() to compare items.

  \sa find(), bsearch()
*/

/*!
  \fn int QVector::find( const type *d, uint i ) const

  Finds the first occurrence of item \a d in the vector, using linear
  search. The search starts at position \a i, which must be less than
  size(). \a i is by default 0; i.e. the search starts at the start of
  the vector.

  Returns the position of \e v, or -1 if \e v could not be found.

  Compares items using the virtual function compareItems().

  \sa findRef(), bsearch()
*/


/*!
  \fn uint QVector::containsRef( const type *d ) const

  Returns the number of occurrences of the item pointer \a d in the
  vector.

  This function does \e not use compareItems() to compare items.

  \sa findRef()
*/

/*!
  \fn uint QVector::contains( const type *d ) const

  Returns the number of occurrences of item \a d in the vector.

  Compares items using the virtual function compareItems().

  \sa containsRef()
*/

/*!
  \fn type *QVector::operator[]( int i ) const

  Returns the item at position \a i, or 0 if there is no item at
  that position. \a i must be less than size().

  Equivalent to at( \a i ).

  \sa at()
*/

/*!
  \fn type *QVector::at( uint i ) const

  Returns the item at position \a i, or 0 if there is no item at
  that position. \a i must be less than size().
*/


/*!
  \fn void QVector::toList( QGList *list ) const

  Copies all items in this vector to the list \a list. First, \a list
  is cleared, then all items are appended to \a list.

  \sa QList, QStack, QQueue
