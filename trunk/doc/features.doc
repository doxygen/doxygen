<UL>
<li>Requires very little overhead from the writer of the documentation. 
    Plain text will do, but for more fancy or structured output HTML tags 
    and/or some of doxygen's special commands can be used.
<li>Cross platform: works on Windows and many Unices (including Linux and
    MacOSX).
<li>Indexes, organizes and generates browsable and cross-referenced 
    output even from undocumented code.
<li>Generates structured XML output for parsed sources, which can be 
    used by external tools.
<li>Supports C/C++, Java, (Corba and Microsoft) Java, Python, VHDL, PHP
    IDL, C#, Objective-C 2.0, and to some extent D and Fortran sources.
<li>Supports documentation of files, namespaces, packages, classes, 
    structs, unions, templates, variables, functions, typedefs, enums and 
    defines. 
<li>JavaDoc (1.1), qdoc3 (partially), and ECMA-334 (C# spec.) compatible.
<li>Comes with a GUI frontend (Doxywizard) to ease editing the options and run doxygen.
    The GUI is available on Windows, Linux, and MacOSX.
<li>Automatically generates class and collaboration diagrams in HTML (as clickable 
    image maps) and \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$ (as Encapsulated PostScript images).
<li>Uses the dot tool of the Graphviz tool kit to generate
    include dependency graphs, collaboration diagrams, call graphs, directory structure
    graphs, and graphical class hierarchy graphs. 
<li>Allows grouping of entities in modules and creating a hierarchy of modules.
<li>Flexible comment placement: Allows you to put documentation in the 
    header file (before the 
    declaration of an entity), source file (before the definition of an entity) 
    or in a separate file.
<li>Generates a list of all members of a class (including any inherited
    members) along with their protection level.
<li>Outputs documentation in on-line format (XHTML and UNIX man page) and 
    off-line format (\f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$ and RTF) simultaneously 
    (any of these can be disabled if desired). All formats are optimized for 
    ease of reading. <br>
    Furthermore, compressed HTML can be generated from HTML output using 
    Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop (Windows only) and PDF can be generated 
    from the \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$ output.
<li>Support for various third party help formats including HTML Help,
    docsets, Qt-Help, and eclipse help.
<li>Includes a full C preprocessor to allow proper parsing of conditional 
    code fragments and to allow expansion of all or part of macros definitions.
<li>Automatically detects public, protected and private sections, as well as
    the Qt specific signal and slots sections. Extraction of private class 
    members is optional.
<li>Automatically generates references to documented classes, files, namespaces
    and members. Documentation of global functions, globals variables, 
    typedefs, defines and enumerations is also supported.
<li>References to base/super classes and inherited/overridden members are 
    generated automatically.
<li>Includes a fast, rank based search engine to search for strings or words 
    in the class and member documentation (PHP based).
<li>Includes an Javascript based live search feature to search for symbols
    as you type (for small to medium sized projects).
<li>You can type normal HTML tags in your documentation. Doxygen will convert
    them to their equivalent \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$, RTF, and man-page 
    counterparts automatically.
<li>Allows references to documentation generated for other (doxygen documented) 
    projects (or another part of the same project) in a location independent way.
<li>Allows inclusion of source code examples that are automatically 
    cross-referenced with the documentation.
<li>Inclusion of undocumented classes is also supported, allowing to quickly
    learn the structure and interfaces of a (large) piece of code without 
    looking into the implementation details.
<li>Allows automatic cross-referencing of (documented) entities with their
    definition in the source code.
<li>All source code fragments are syntax highlighted for ease of reading.
<li>Allows inclusion of function/member/class definitions in the documentation.
<li>All options are read from an easy to edit and (optionally) annotated 
    configuration file.
<li>Documentation and search engine can be transferred to another 
    location or machine without regenerating the documentation.
<li>Supports many different character encodings and uses UTF-8 internally and
    for the generated output.
<li>Doxygen can generate a layout which you can use and edit to change the
    layout of each page.
<li>There more than a 100 configurable options to fine-tune the output.
<li>Can cope with large projects easily.

Although doxygen can now be used in any project written in a language that is 
supported by doxygen, initially it was specifically designed to be used for projects 
that make use of Qt Software's 
<A HREF="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt.html">Qt toolkit</A>. I have tried to 
make doxygen `Qt-compatible'. That is: Doxygen can read the documentation contained in 
the Qt source code and create a class browser that looks quite similar to the 
one that is generated by Qt Software. Doxygen understands the C++ extensions 
used by Qt such as signals and slots and many of the markup commands used in the Qt sources.

Doxygen can also automatically generate links to existing documentation
that was generated with Doxygen or with Qt's non-public class browser 
generator. For a Qt based project this means that whenever you refer to 
members or classes belonging to the Qt toolkit, a link will be generated to 
the Qt documentation. This is done independent of where this documentation 
is located!
