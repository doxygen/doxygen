/*! \page doxygen_usage Doxygen usage

Doxygen is a command line based utility.  Calling \c doxygen with the
\c --help option at the command line will give you a brief description of the 
usage of the program.

All options consist of a leading character <tt>-</tt>, 
followed by one character and one or more arguments depending on the option.

To generate a manual for your project you typically 
need to follow these steps:
<ol>
<li> You document your source code with 
     special documentation blocks (see section \ref specialblock).
<li> You generate a configuration file (see section \ref config) by 
     calling doxygen with the \c -g option:
\verbatim
doxygen -g <config_file>
\endverbatim
<li> You edit the configuration file so it matches your project.
     In the configuration file you can specify the input files and
     a lot of optional information.
<li> You let doxygen generate the documentation, based on the settings in the
     configuration file:
\verbatim
doxygen <config_file>
\endverbatim
</ol>

If you have a configuration file generated with an older version of
doxygen, you can upgrade it to the current version by running doxygen
with the -u option.
\verbatim
doxygen -u <config_file>
\endverbatim
All configuration settings in the original configuration file will be copied
to the new configuration file. Any new options will have their default value.
Note that comments that you may have added in the original configuration file 
will be lost.

\section doxygen_finetune Fine-tuning the output
If you want to fine-tune the way the output looks, doxygen allows you 
generate default style sheet, header, and footer files that you can edit
afterwards:
<ul>
<li>For HTML output, you can generate the default header file 
    (see \ref cfg_html_header "HTML_HEADER"), the default footer 
    (see \ref cfg_html_footer "HTML_FOOTER"), and the default style
    sheet (see \ref cfg_html_stylesheet "HTML_STYLESHEET"), using the
    following command:
\verbatim
doxygen -w html header.html footer.html stylesheet.css <config_file>
\endverbatim
  The config_file is optional. When omitted doxygen will search for 
  a file named Doxyfile and process that. When this is also not found it
  will used the default settings.

<li>For LaTeX output, you can generate the first part of \c refman.tex 
    (see \ref cfg_latex_header "LATEX_HEADER") and the style sheet included
    by that header (normally <code>doxygen.sty</code>), using:
\verbatim
doxygen -w latex header.tex doxygen.sty
\endverbatim
If you need non-default options (for instance to use pdflatex) you need
to make a config file with those options set correctly and then specify
that config file as the third argument. 
<li>For RTF output, you can generate the default style sheet file (see
    \ref cfg_rtf_stylesheet_file "RTF_STYLESHEET_FILE") using:
\verbatim
doxygen -w rtf rtfstyle.cfg
\endverbatim
</ul>
\warning When using a custom header you are responsible 
  for the proper inclusion of any scripts and style sheets that doxygen 
  needs, which is dependent on the configuration options and may changes
  when upgrading to a new doxygen release.

\note
<ul>
<li> If you do not want documentation for each item inside the configuration
     file then you can use the optional \c -s option. This can use be
     used in combination with the \c -u option, to add or strip the
     documentation from an existing configuration file.
     Please use the \c -s option if you send me a configuration file 
     as part of a bug report!
<li> To make doxygen read/write to standard input/output instead of from/to 
     a file, use \c - for the file name.
</ul>
