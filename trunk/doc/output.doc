/*! \page output Output Formats

\addindex output formats

The following output formats are \e directly supported by doxygen:
<dl>
<dt><b>HTML</b>
<dd>Generated if \c GENERATE_HTML is set to \c YES in the configuration file.
<dt>\f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$
<dd>Generated if \c GENERATE_LATEX is set to \c YES in the configuration file.
<dt><b>Man pages</b>
<dd>Generated if \c GENERATE_MAN is set to \c YES in the configuration file.
<dt><b>RTF</b>
<dd>Generated if \c GENERATE_RTF is set to \c YES in the configuration file.<p>
    Note that the RTF output probably only looks nice with Microsoft's 
    Word. If you have success with other programs, please let me know.
<dt><b>XML</b>
<dd>Generated if \c GENERATE_XML is set to \c YES in the configuration file.<p>
</dl>

The following output formats are \e indirectly supported by doxygen:
<dl>
<dt><b>Compiled HTML Help</b> (a.k.a. Windows 98 help)
<dd>Generated by Microsoft's HTML Help workshop from the HTML output if 
    \c GENERATE_HTMLHELP is set to \c YES.
<dt><b>Qt Compressed Help (.qch)</b>
<dd>Generated by Qt's qhelpgenerator tool from the HTML output if 
    \c GENERATE_QHP is set to \c YES.
<dt><b>Eclipse Help</b>
<dd>Generated from HTML with a special index file that is generated when
    \c GENERATE_ECLIPSEHELP is set to \c YES.
<dt><b>XCode DocSets</b>
<dd>Compiled from HTML with a special index file that is generated when
    \c GENERATE_DOCSET is set to \c YES.
<dt><b>PostScript</b>
<dd>Generated from the \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$ output by 
    running <code>make ps</code> in the output directory.
    For the best results \c PDF_HYPERLINKS should be set to \c NO.
<dt><b>PDF</b>\htmlonly &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\endhtmlonly
<dd>Generated from the \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$ output by
    running <code>make pdf</code> in the output directory.
    To improve the PDF output, you typically would want to enable the use 
    of \c pdflatex by setting \ref cfg_use_pdflatex "USE_PDFLATEX" to \c YES in the 
    configuration file. In order to get hyperlinks in the PDF file you also need to enable
    \ref cfg_pdf_hyperlinks "PDF_HYPERLINKS".
