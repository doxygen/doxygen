  \class QValueList qvaluelist.h
  \brief The QValueList class is a value based template class that provides doubly linked lists.

  \ingroup qtl
  \ingroup tools
  \ingroup shared

  Define a template instance QValueList\<X\> to create a list of values which all
  have the class X. Please notice that QValueList does not store pointers to the
  members of the list. It holds a copy of every member. That is the reason why this
  kind of classes are called "value based" while QList and QDict are "reference based".

  Some classes can not be used within a QValueList,  for example everything
  derived from QObject and thus all classes that implement widgets.
  Only values can be used in a QValueList. To qualify as a value, the class
  must provide
  <ul>
  <li>a copy constructor,
  <li>an assignment operator and
  <li> a default constructor, i.e. a constructor that does not take any arguments.
  </ul>

  Note that C++ defaults to field-by-field assignment operators and
  copy constructors if no explicit version is supplied. In many cases,
  this is sufficient.

  Example:
  \code
    #include <qvaluelist.h>
    #include <qstring.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    class Employee
    {
    public:
	Employee(): s(0) {}
	Employee( const QString& name, int salary )
	    : n(name), s(salary)
	{}

	QString     name()   const	 	{ return n; }
	int	    salary() const	 	{ return s; }
	void	    setSalary( int salary )	{ s = salary; }
    private:
	QString     n;
	int         s;
    };

    void main()
    {
	typedef QValueList<Employee> EmployeeList;
	EmployeeList list;		// list of Employee

	list.append( Employee("Bill", 50000) );
	list.append( Employee("Steve",80000) );
	list.append( Employee("Ron",  60000) );

	Employee joe( "Joe", 50000 );
	list.append( joe );
	joe.setSalary( 4000 );
	
	EmployeeList::Iterator it;
	for( it = list.begin(); it != list.end(); ++it )
	    printf( "%s earns %d\n", (*it).name().latin1(), (*it).salary().latin1() );
    }
  \endcode

  Program output:
  \code
	Bill earns 50000
	Steve earns 80000
	Ron earns 60000
	Joe earns 50000
  \endcode

  As you can see, the latest changes to Joes salary did not affect the value
  in the list because the list created a copy of Joes entry.

  There are three ways of finding items in the list. The first one is by using
  the at() function. It returns an iterator. The advantages of
  getting an iterator is that you can now move forward or backward from this
  position by incrementing/decrementing the iterator. To get the amount of
  items in the list call count(). Valid indices are 0..count().

  The second way of accessing a list is with operator[]. That means you can address
  it like an array. The return value is a reference to the value stored in the list.
  There exist two versions of this operator. The first one is const and returns a
  const reference to the value. The second on is non const and returns a non const
  reference to the value. It is up to your compiler to choose the correct one.

  The third method is to use the functions begin() and end().
  With a simple for loop as shown in the example you can iterate over the complete list.
  It is save to have multiple iterators at the same time. If some member of the list is
  removed then only iterators pointing to the removed member become invalid. Inserting in
  the list does not invalidate any iterator. For convenience the function last() returns
  an iterator for the last and first() for the first element in the list.

  In addition you can search items in the list with the find() function. It exists in a const
  and a non const version. It starts searching from the beginning of the list, but another
  flavor of the find() function allows you to specify where searching should start.
  If you just want to know wether a certain item is at least once in the list, then you
  can use the contains() function.

  Since QValueList is value based there is no need to care about deleting elements in the
  list. The list holds its own copies and will free them if the corresponding member or
  the list itself is deleted. You can force the list to free all of its item with clear().

  QValueList is implicitly shared. That means you can just make copies of the list
  in time O(1). If multiple QValueList instances share the same data and one
  is doing a modification of the lists data then this modifying instance makes a copy
  and modifies its private copy. So it does not affect the other instances.
  From a developers point of view you can think that a QValueList and a copy of this
  list have nothing to do with each other. Developers may only notice that copying is
  very fast. People known to a CPUs MMU architecture will know this pattern as "copy on write".

  There exist three functions to insert items in the list. append()
  inserts an item at the end, prepend() inserts at the beginning
  and insert() inserts in front of the position given by an iterator.

  Items can be removed from the list in two ways. The first is to pass an iterator to
  the remove(). The other possibility is to pass a value to remove() which will
  delete all members which match this value.

  Lists can be sorted with the algorithms provided by the <a
  href="qtl.html">Qt Template Library</a>, for example with
  qHeapSort():

  Example:
  \code
	  QValueList l;
	  l.append( 5 );
	  l.append( 8 );
	  l.append( 3 );
	  l.append( 4 );
	  qHeapSort( l );
  \endcode

/*!
  \fn QValueList::QValueList()
  Constructs an empty list.
*/

/*!
  \fn QValueList::QValueList( const QValueList<T>& l )
  Constructs a copy of \e l.

  This operation costs O(1) time since QValueList is implicit shared.
  The first instance applying modifications to a shared list will create
  a copy which takes in turn O(n) time. However returning a QValueList from

  \class QValueListIterator qvaluelist.h
  \brief The QValueListIterator class provides an iterator for QValueList.

  \ingroup qtl
  \ingroup tools

  You can not create an iterator by yourself. Instead you have to
  ask a list to give you one. An iterator has only the size of a pointer.
  On 32 bit machines that means 4 bytes otherwise 8 bytes. That makes them
  very fast. In fact they resemble the semantics of pointers as good as possible
  and they are almost as fast as usual pointers.

  Example:
  \code
    #include <qvaluelist.h>
    #include <qstring.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    class Employee
    {
    public:
	Employee(): s(0) {}
	Employee( const QString& name, int salary )
	    : n(name), s(salary)
	{}

	QString     name()   const		{ return n; }
	int	    salary() const		{ return s; }
	void	    setSalary( int salary )	{ s = salary; }
    private:
	QString     n;
	int         s;
    };

    void main()
	{
	    typedef QValueList<Employee> EmployeeList;
	    EmployeeList list;		// list of Employee

	    list.append( Employee("Bill", 50000) );
	    list.append( Employee("Steve",80000) );
	    list.append( Employee("Ron",  60000) );

	    Employee joe( "Joe", 50000 );
	    list.append( joe );
	    joe.setSalary( 4000 );
	
	    EmployeeList::Iterator it;
	    for( it = list.begin(); it != list.end(); ++it )
		printf( "%s earns %d\n", (*it).name().latin1(), (*it).salary() );
	}
  \endcode

  Program output:
  \code
	Bill earns 50000
	Steve earns 80000
	Ron earns 60000
	Joe earns 50000
  \endcode

  In contrast to QList there are no built in functions in QValueList to
  traverse the list. The only way to do this is to use iterators.
  QValueList is highly optimized for performance and memory usage.
  On the other hand that means that you have to be a bit more careful
  by what you are doing. QValueList does not know about all its iterators
  and the iterators dont even know to which list they belong. That makes
  things fast and slim but a bit dangerous because it is up to you to make
  sure that iterators you are using are still valid. QListIterator will be able
  to give warnings while QValueListIterator may end up in an undefined state.

  For every Iterator there is a ConstIterator. When accessing a QValueList
  in a const environment or if the reference or pointer to the list is itself
  const, then you have to use the ConstIterator. Its semantics are the same,
  but it returns only const references to the item it points to.
