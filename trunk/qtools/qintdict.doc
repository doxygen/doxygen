  \class QIntDict qintdict.h
  \brief The QIntDict class is a template class that provides a dictionary based on \c long keys.

  \ingroup collection
  \ingroup tools

  QIntDict is implemented as a template class. Define a
  template instance QIntDict\<X\> to create a dictionary that operates on
  pointers to X, or X*.

  A dictionary is a collection that associates an item with a key.
  The key is used for inserting and looking up an item.  QIntDict has
  \c long keys.

  The dictionary has very fast insertion and lookup.

  Example:
  \code
    #include <qintdict.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    void main()
    {
	QIntDict<char> dict;		// maps long ==> char*

	dict.insert( 33, "France" );
	dict.insert(  7, "Russia" );
	dict.insert( 49, "Norway" );

	printf( "%s\n", dict[49] );
	printf( "%s\n", dict[33] );
	printf( "%s\n", dict[7] );

	if ( !dict[39] )
	    printf( "39 not defined\n" );
    }
  \endcode

  Program output:
  \code
	Norway
	France
	Russia
	39 not defined
  \endcode

  The dictionary in our example maps \c long keys to \c char* items.
  QIntDict implements the \link operator[] [] operator\endlink to lookup
  an item.

  QIntDict is implemented by QGDict as a hash array with a fixed number of
  entries. Each array entry points to a singly linked list of buckets, in
  which the dictionary items are stored.

  When an item is inserted with a key, the key is converted (hashed) to
  an integer index into the hash array using the \c mod operation. The
  item is inserted before the first bucket in the list of buckets.

  Looking up an item is normally very fast. The key is again hashed to an
  array index. Then QIntDict scans the list of buckets and returns the item
  found or null if the item was not found.  You cannot insert null pointers
  into a dictionary.

  The size of the hash array is very important. In order to get good
  performance, you should use a suitably large \link primes.html prime
  number\endlink.  Suitable means equal to or larger than the maximum
  expected number of dictionary items.

  Items with equal keys are allowed.  When inserting two items with the
  same key, only the last inserted item will be visible (last in, first out)
  until it is removed.

  Example:
  \code
    #include <qintdict.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    void main()
    {
	QIntDict<char> dict;		// maps long ==> char*

	dict.insert( 7, "Russia" );
	dict.insert( 7, "USSR" );

	printf( "%s\n", dict[7] );
	dict.remove( 7 );		// Gorbie was here
	printf( "%s\n", dict[7] );
    }
  \endcode

  Program output:
  \code
	USSR
	Russia
  \endcode

  The QIntDictIterator class can traverse the dictionary contents, but only
  in an arbitrary order.  Multiple iterators may independently traverse the
  same dictionary.

  Calling setAutoDelete(TRUE) for a dictionary tells it to delete items
  that are removed .  The default is to not delete items when they are
  removed.

  When inserting an item into a dictionary, only the pointer is copied, not
  the item itself. This is called a shallow copy. It is possible to make the
  dictionary copy all of the item's data (known as a deep copy) when an
  item is inserted.  insert() calls the virtual function
  QCollection::newItem() for the item to be inserted.
  Inherit a dictionary and reimplement it if you want deep copies.

  When removing a dictionary item, the virtual function
  QCollection::deleteItem() is called.  QIntDict's default implementation
  is to delete the item if auto-deletion is enabled.

  QIntDictIterator is implemented as a template class.
  Define a template instance QIntDictIterator\<X\> to create a
  dictionary iterator that operates on QIntDict\<X\> (dictionary of X*).

  Example:
  \code
    #include <qintdict.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    void main()

	dict.insert( 49, "Norway" );

	QIntDictIterator<char> it( dict ); // iterator for dict

  Note that the traversal order is arbitrary, you are not guaranteed the
  order above.

  Multiple iterators may independently traverse the same dictionary.
  A QIntDict knows about all iterators that are operating on the dictionary.
  When an item is removed from the dictionary, QIntDict update all
  iterators that are referring the removed item to point to the next item
  in the traversing order.
