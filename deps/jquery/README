Doxygen's jquery.js script is composed of minified versions of the following
packages:
- jquery    3.6.0:  https://jquery.com/download/
- jquery.ui 1.13.2: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
    modules required:
    - jquery.ui.core          all
    - jquery.ui.interactions  resizable
    - jquery.ui.widgets       mouse
- jquery.scrollTo:   2.1.2: https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo
- jquery.powertip:   1.3.1: https://stevenbenner.github.io/jquery-powertip/
- jquery.touchpunch: 0.2.3: http://touchpunch.furf.com/ + fix for issue 303
- jquery.smartmenus: 1.1.0: https://www.smartmenus.org/

The Makefile will built the jquery.js files used by doxygen.

Note that there is a performance issue in the default powertip version.
See https://github.com/stevenbenner/jquery-powertip/issues/178
Until that is fixed a modified version is shipped with doxygen. This version
removes the "destroy" functionality which was not used by doxygen anyway.
