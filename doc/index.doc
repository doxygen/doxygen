<h2>Introduction</h2>
Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, Objective-C, Python, IDL 
(Corba and Microsoft flavors) and to some extent PHP, C#, and D.

It can help you in three ways:
<ol>
<li> It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an 
     off-line reference manual (in \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$) from a set 
     of documented source files. 
     There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), 
     PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages.
     The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which
     makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the
     source code.
<li> You can \ref extract_all "configure" doxygen to extract the code structure 
     from undocumented source files. This is very useful to quickly 
     find your way in large source distributions. 
     You can also visualize the relations between the various elements 
     by means of include dependency graphs, inheritance diagrams,
     and collaboration diagrams, which are all generated automatically.
<li> You can even `abuse' doxygen for creating normal documentation (as I did
     for this manual).
</ol>

Doxygen is developed under <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a>
and Mac OS X, but is set-up to be highly portable. As a result, it 
runs on most other Unix flavors as well. Furthermore, executables for 
Windows are available.

\n This manual is divided into three parts, each of which is divided into several 
sections.

The first part forms a user manual:
<ul>
<li>Section \ref install discusses how to 
      <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/download.html">download</a>, compile and install
                     doxygen for your platform.
<li>Section \ref starting tells you how to generate your first piece of 
                     documentation quickly. 
<li>Section \ref docblocks demonstrates the various ways that code can
                 be documented.
<li>Section \ref lists show various ways to create lists. 
<li>Section \ref grouping shows how to group things together. 
<li>Section \ref formulas shows how to insert formulas in the documentation.
<li>Section \ref diagrams describes the diagrams and graphs that doxygen can generate.
<li>Section \ref preprocessing explains how doxygen deals with macro definitions.
<li>Section \ref autolink shows how to put links to files, classes, 
                 and members in the documentation.
<li>Section \ref output shows how to generate the various output formats
                 supported by doxygen.
<li>Section \ref external explains how to let doxygen create links to externally generated documentation.
<li>Section \ref faq gives answers to frequently asked questions. 
<li>Section \ref trouble tells you what to do when you have problems.
</ul>

The second part forms a reference manual:

<ul>
<li>Section \ref features presents an overview of what doxygen can do.
<li>Section \ref history shows what has changed during the development 
                 of doxygen and what still has to be done.
<li>Section \ref doxygen_usage shows how to use the \c doxygen program.
<li>Section \ref doxytag_usage shows how to use the \c doxytag program.
<li>Section \ref doxywizard_usage shows how to use the \c doxywizard program. 
<li>Section \ref installdox_usage shows how to use the \c installdox
                 script that is generated by doxygen if you use tag files. 
<li>Section \ref config shows how to fine-tune doxygen, so it 
              generates the documentation you want.
<li>Section \ref commands shows an overview of the special commands that can be 
              used within the documentation.
<li>Section \ref htmlcmds shows an overview of the HTML commands that
              can be used within the documentation.
<li>Section \ref xmlcmds shows an overview of the C# style XML commands that
              can be used within the documentation.
</ul>

The third part provides information for developers:

<ul>
<li>Section \ref arch gives a global overview of how doxygen is internally
    structured.
<li>Section \ref perlmod shows how to use the PerlMod output.
<li>Section \ref langhowto explains how to add support for new
              output languages.
</ul>

<h2>User examples</h2>

Doxygen supports a number of \ref output "output formats" where HTML is the
most popular one. I've gathered 
\htmlonly
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org/results.html">some nice examples</a> 
\endhtmlonly
\latexonly
some nice examples (see {\tt http://www.doxygen.org/results.html})
\endlatexonly
of real-life projects using doxygen.

These are part of a larger
\htmlonly
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org/projects.html">list of projects</a> 
that use doxygen.
\endhtmlonly
\latexonly
list of projects that use doxygen (see {\tt http://www.doxygen.org/projects.html}).
\endlatexonly
If you know other projects, let me know and I'll add them. 

<h2>Future work</h2>
Although doxygen is used successfully by a lot of people already, 
there is always room for improvement. Therefore, I have compiled a 
\htmlonly
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org/todo.html">todo/wish list</a>
\endhtmlonly 
\latexonly
todo/wish list (see {\tt http://www.doxygen.org/todo.html})
\endlatexonly
of possible and/or requested enhancements. 

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
\addindex acknowledgements
Thanks go to:
<ul>
<li>\addindex Doc++
    Malte Z&ouml;ckler and Roland Wunderling, authors of DOC++.
    The first version of doxygen borrowed some code of an old version of DOC++. 
    Although I have rewritten practically all code since then, DOC++ has still 
    given me a good start in writing doxygen.
<li>All people at Troll Tech, for creating a beautiful GUI Toolkit
    (which is very useful as a Windows/Unix platform abstraction layer :-)
<li>My brother Frank
    for rendering the logos.
<li>Harm van der Heijden for adding HTML help support.
<li>Wouter Slegers of 
    <a href="http://www.yourcreativesolutions.nl">Your Creative Solutions</a> 
    for registering the www.doxygen.org domain.
<li>Parker Waechter for adding the RTF output generator.
<li>Joerg Baumann, for adding conditional documentation blocks, 
    PDF links, and the configuration generator.
<li>Matthias Andree for providing a .spec script for building rpms from the
    sources.
<li>Tim Mensch for adding the todo command.
<li>Christian Hammond for redesigning the web-site.
<li>Ken Wong for providing the HTML tree view code.
<li>Talin for adding support for C# style comments with XML markup.
<li>Petr Prikryl for coordinating the internationalisation support.
    All language maintainers for providing translations into many languages.
<li>Gerald Steffens of <a href="http://www.e-trend.de">E-trend</a>
    for financial support.
<li>The band <a href="http://www.porcupinetree.com">Porcupine Tree</a> for 
    providing hours of great music to listen to while coding.
<li>many, many others for suggestions, patches and bug reports.
</ul>
