/*! \page doxywizard_usage Doxywizard usage

Doxywizard is a GUI front-end for configuring and running doxygen.

When starting doxywizard one can specify an existing configuration file to use as argument,
otherwise the default settings will be used as a starting point.

When you start doxywizard it will display the main window
(the actual look depends on the platform used).

\image latex doxywizard_main.png "Main window" width=15cm

The user interface consists of the following sections:
<dl>
<dt>\ref dw_menu
<dd> In the menu bar the following parts are available:
\ref dw_menu_file, \ref dw_menu_settings and \ref dw_menu_help.

<dt>Specify the working directory from which doxygen will run
<dd>
Using the <tt>Select...</tt> button a directory can be selected.
When doxywizard is started with a configuration file or one is loaded using the open command
(see: \ref dw_menu_file) the directory of this settings file used as the working directory.

<dt>Configure doxygen using the Wizard and/or Expert tab...
<dd>
  <dl>
  <dt>\ref dw_wizard <dd>with this tab it is possible to quickly configure the most
                       important settings and leave the rest of the options to
                       their defaults.
  <dt>\ref dw_expert <dd>with this tab one gains access to the \ref config
                       "full set of configuration options".
  <dt>\ref dw_run <dd>with this tab it is possible to run doxygen and view the used settings.
  </dl>

Switching between these tabs is possible, e.g you could start with the wizard tab
and then fine tune some settings by switching to the expert tab.

</dl>

After doxygen is configured you need to save (see: \ref dw_menu_file) the configuration as a file
to disk. This allows doxygen to use the configuration
and also allows running doxygen again with the same settings at a later point in time.

Since some configuration options may use relative paths, be sure to
select a working directory that is root of those paths.
This is often the root of the source tree and will typically be correctly filled in
if the configuration file is stored at this location as well.

Once the configuration file is saved and the working directory is set, you
can run doxygen based on the selected settings. Do this by switching to the
\ref dw_run "Run" tab, and click the "Run doxygen" button.

Once doxygen runs you can cancel it by clicking the same
button again. The output produced by doxygen is captured and shown in the "Output produced by doxygen"
pane. Once doxygen finishes, the log can be saved as a text file.

\section dw_wizard Wizard tab

The Wizard tab is divided into two panes
<dl>
<dt>Left pane<dd>The main topics for easy setting up doxygen.
By clicking on a topic the corresponding settings will appear in the Right
pane.
<dt>Right pane<dd>The wizard's settings pane, in this pane you will find the
settings that are available for the selected topic.
</dl>

The wizard only gives the possibility to quickly setup doxygen, for full control
one should use the \ref dw_expert.

\subsection dw_wizard_project Project settings

The fields in the Project pane speak for themselves. Once doxygen has finished
the Destination directory is where to look for the results. Doxygen will
put each output format in a separate sub-directory by default.

\forceNewPage
\subsection dw_wizard_mode Mode of operating

The Mode pane allows you to select how doxygen will look at your sources.
The default is to only look for things that have been documented. Furthermore, the
terminology used in the output can be changed to better match the main programming language used
(this doesn't affect the way doxygen parses your source code).

\subsection dw_wizard_output Output to produce

The Output pane allows you to select what kinds of output doxygen will produce.
For HTML and \LaTeX there are additional options available.

\subsection dw_wizard_diagrams Diagrams to generate

Doxygen can produce a number of diagrams. Using the Diagrams pane you
can select which ones to generate. For most diagrams the
`dot` tool of the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org">GraphViz</a> package
is needed. This needs to be installed separately.

\image html doxywizard_page4.png "Wizard tab: Diagrams to generate"
\image latex doxywizard_page4.png "Wizard tab: Diagrams to generate" width=15cm

\section dw_expert Expert tab

The Expert tab is divided into a number of panes:
<dl>
<dt>Top left pane<dd>The Topics pane (i.e. sections in the
configuration file) that are available. By clicking on a topic the
corresponding settings will appear in the Right pane.
<dt>Bottom left pane<dd>The help pane, this will be updated when one
hovers over the name of a setting in the Right pane.
<dt>Right pane<dd>The Settings pane, in this pane you will find the
settings that are available for the selected topic. In case the name for a setting is colored
red, the setting has a non-default value.
In case a setting is grayed out, the setting is depending on another setting that is disabled.
Which setting it depends on is indicated in the help pane on the bottom left.
</dl>

\image html doxywizard_expert.png "Some options from the Expert tab"
\image latex doxywizard_expert.png "Some options from the Expert tab" width=15cm

The representation of the input field depends on the type of the configuration option.
<ul>
<li>For each boolean option (those options that are answered with `YES` or
    `NO` in the configuration file) there is a check-box. A typical field
    looks like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_bool.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_bool.png width=4.6cm
<li>For items taking one of a fixed set of values (like
    \ref cfg_output_language "OUTPUT_LANGUAGE") a combo box is used.
    A typical field looks like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_enum.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_enum.png width=7.3cm
<li>For items taking an integer value from a range, a spinbox is used.
    A typical field looks like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_int.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_int.png width=10.1cm
<li>For free form string-type options there is a one line edit field.
    A typical field looks like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_string_string.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_string_string.png width=12.3cm
    <br>Additionally, when the string field should contain a file or a folder name, there are the special buttons
    \image{inline} html images/file.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/file.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    and
    \image{inline} html images/folder.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/folder.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    that start a file / folder selection dialog.
    A typical field for a file looks like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_string_file.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_string_file.png width=11.0cm
    <br>and a folder looks like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_string_dir.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_string_dir.png width=11.0cm
    <br>and in case both a file or a folder is allowed, the look is:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_string_filedir.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_string_filedir.png width=11.0cm
    <br>In case a file represents an image, doxygen also tries to display the selected image.
    Then a typical field looks like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_string_image.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_string_image.png width=11.8cm
<li>For options taking a list of strings, an editor field is
    shown with a non-editable list below it. The
    \image{inline} html images/add.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/add.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    button adds the string in the editor field to the list and a the
    \image{inline} html images/del.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/del.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    button removes the selected string from the list. The
    \image{inline} html images/refresh.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/refresh.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    button can be clicked to replace the selected item in the list with the string entered in the editor field.
    A typical field looks like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_list_string.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_list_string.png width=11.2cm
    <br>additionally when the list contains file and / or folder names, there are special buttons
    \image{inline} html images/file.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/file.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    and
    \image{inline} html images/folder.png height=14px \ilinebr \image{inline} latex images/folder.png height=\DoxyInlineHeightChar
    that start a file / folder selection dialog.
    A typical field would for a file looks like:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_list_file.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_list_file.png width=11.2cm
    <br>and for a folder it looks like<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_list_dir.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_list_dir.png width=11.2cm
    <br>and in case both files and folders are allowed, the look is:<br>
    \image{inline} html expert_list_filedir.png
    \image{inline} latex expert_list_filedir.png width=11.9cm
</ul>

\section dw_run Run tab
