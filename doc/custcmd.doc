/*! \page custcmd Custom Commands

\tableofcontents

Doxygen provides a large number of \ref commands "special commands", 
\ref xmlcmds "XML commands", and \ref htmlcmds "HTML commands".
that can be used to enhance or structure the documentation inside a comment block. 
If you for some reason have a need to define new commands you can do
so by means of an \e alias definition. 

The definition of an alias should be specified in the configuration file using
the \ref cfg_aliases "ALIASES" configuration tag.

\section custcmd_simple Simple aliases
The simplest form of an alias is a simple substitution of the form
\verbatim
 name=value
\endverbatim
 For example defining the following alias: 
\verbatim
 ALIASES += sideeffect="\par Side Effects:\n" 
\endverbatim
 will allow you to
 put the command `\sideeffect` (or `@sideeffect`) in the documentation, which 
 will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading <b>Side Effects:</b>.

Note that you can put `\n`'s in the value part of an alias to insert newlines
(in the resulting output). You can put `^^` in the value part of an alias to
insert a newline as if a physical newline was in the original file.

Also note that you can redefine existing special commands if you wish.

Some commands, such as \ref cmdxrefitem "\\xrefitem" are designed to be used in
combination with aliases. 

\section custcmd_complex Aliases with arguments
Aliases can also have one or more arguments. In the alias definition you then need
to specify the number of arguments between curly braces. In the value part of the
definition you can place `\x` markers, where '`x`' represents the argument number starting
with 1.

Here is an example of an alias definition with a single argument:
\verbatim
ALIASES += l{1}="\ref \1"
\endverbatim

Inside a comment block you can use it as follows
\verbatim
/** See \l{SomeClass} for more information. */
\endverbatim
which would be the same as writing
\verbatim
/** See \ref SomeClass for more information. */
\endverbatim

Note that you can overload an alias by a version with multiple arguments, for instance:
\verbatim
ALIASES += l{1}="\ref \1"
ALIASES += l{2}="\ref \1 \"\2\""
\endverbatim
Note that the quotes inside the alias definition have to be escaped with a backslash.

With these alias definitions, we can write
\verbatim
/** See \l{SomeClass,Some Text} for more information. */
\endverbatim
inside the comment block and it will expand to
\verbatim
/** See \ref SomeClass "Some Text" for more information. */
\endverbatim
where the command with a single argument would still work as shown before.

Aliases can also be expressed in terms of other aliases, e.g. a new command
`\reminder` can be expressed as a \ref cmdxrefitem "\\xrefitem" via an intermediate `\xreflist` command
as follows:
\verbatim
ALIASES += xreflist{3}="\xrefitem \1 \"\2\" \"\3\" "
ALIASES += reminder="\xreflist{reminders,Reminder,Reminders}"
\endverbatim

Note that if for aliases with more than one argument a comma is used as a separator,
if you want to put a comma inside the command, you will need to escape it with a backslash,
i.e. 
\verbatim
\l{SomeClass,Some text\, with an escaped comma} 
\endverbatim
given the alias definition of `\l` in the example above.

\section custcmd_nesting Nesting custom command

You can use commands as arguments of aliases, including commands
defined using aliases.

As an example consider the following alias definitions

\verbatim
ALIASES += Bold{1}="<b>\1</b>"
ALIASES += Emph{1}="<em>\1</em>"
\endverbatim

Inside a comment block you can now use:
\verbatim
/** This is a \Bold{bold \Emph{and} Emphasized} text fragment. */
\endverbatim
which will expand to
\verbatim
/** This is a <b>bold <em>and</em> Emphasized</b> text fragment. */
\endverbatim


\htmlonly
<br/>
Go to the <a href="external.html">next</a> section or return to the
 <a href="index.html">index</a>.
\endhtmlonly
