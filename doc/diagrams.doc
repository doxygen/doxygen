/*! \page diagrams Graphs and diagrams

  Doxygen has built-in support to generate inheritance diagrams for C++
  classes. 

  Doxygen can use the "dot" tool from graphviz 1.5 to generate
  more advanced diagrams and graphs. Graphviz is an "open-sourced", 
  cross-platform graph drawing toolkit and can be found 
  at http://www.graphviz.org/

  If you have the "dot" tool available in the path, you can set
  \ref cfg_have_dot "HAVE_DOT" to \c YES in the configuration file to 
  let doxygen use it.

  Doxygen uses the "dot" tool to generate the following graphs:
  <ul>
  <li>if \ref cfg_graphical_hierarchy "GRAPHICAL_HIERARCHY" is set to \c YES, 
      a graphical representation of the class hierarchy will be drawn, along 
      with the textual one. Currently this feature is supported for HTML only.\n
      <b>Warning:</b> When you have a very large class hierarchy where many 
      classes derive from a common base class, the resulting image may become 
      too big to handle for some browsers.
  <li>if \ref cfg_class_graph "CLASS_GRAPH" is set to \c YES,
      a graph will be generated for each documented class showing the 
      direct and indirect inheritance relations. This disables the
      generation of the built-in class inheritance diagrams.
  <li>if \ref cfg_include_graph "INCLUDE_GRAPH" is set to \c YES, an include 
      dependency graph is generated for each documented file that includes at 
      least one other file. This feature is currently supported for HTML and RTF 
      only.
  <li>if \ref cfg_collaboration_graph "COLLABORATION_GRAPH" is set to YES, a 
      graph is drawn for each documented class and struct that shows:
      <ul>
      <li> the inheritance relations with base classes.
      <li> the usage relations with other structs and classes (e.g. 
           class \c A has a member variable \c m_a of type class \c B, then
           \c A has an arrow to \c B with \c m_a as label).
      </ul>
  <li>if \ref cfg_call_graph "CALL_GRAPH" is set to YES, a 
      graphical call graph is drawn for each function showing the 
      functions that the function directly or indirectly calls.
  <li>if \ref cfg_caller_graph "CALLER_GRAPH" is set to YES, a 
      graphical caller graph is drawn for each function showing the 
      functions that the function is directly or indirectly called by.
  </ul>

  The elements in the class diagrams in HTML and RTF 
  have the following meaning:
  <ul>
  <li> A \b yellow box indicates a class. A box can have a 
       little marker in the lower right corner to indicate that the class 
       contains base classes that are hidden. 
       For the class diagrams the maximum tree width is currently 8 elements. 
       If a tree is wider some nodes will be hidden.
       If the box is filled with a 
       dashed pattern the inheritance relation is virtual.
  <li> A \b white box indicates that the documentation of the class
       is currently shown.
  <li> A \b grey box indicates an undocumented class.
  <li> A <b>solid dark blue</b> arrow indicates public inheritance.
  <li> A <b>dashed dark green</b> arrow indicates protected inheritance.
  <li> A <b>dotted dark green</b> arrow indicates private inheritance.
  </ul>

  The elements in the class diagram in \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$ have the 
  following meaning:
  <ul>
  <li> A \b white box indicates a class.
       A \b marker in the lower right corner of the box indicates that the 
       class has base classes that are hidden. 
       If the box has a \b dashed border this indicates virtual inheritance.
  <li> A \b solid arrow indicates public inheritance.
  <li> A \b dashed arrow indicates protected inheritance.
  <li> A \b dotted arrow indicates private inheritance.
  </ul>

  The elements in the graphs generated by the dot tool have the following
  meaning:
  <ul>
  <li> A \b white box indicates a class or struct or file. 
  <li> A box with a \b red border indicates a node that has
       \e more arrows than are shown! 
       In other words: the graph is \e truncated with respect to this node.
       The reason why a graph is sometimes truncated is to prevent images
       from becoming too large. 
       For the graphs generated with dot doxygen tries
       to limit the width of the resulting image to 1024 pixels.  
  <li> A \b black box indicates that the class' documentation is currently shown.
  <li> A <b>dark blue</b> arrow indicates an include relation (for the 
       include dependency graph) or public inheritance (for the other graphs).
  <li> A <b>dark green</b> arrow indicates protected inheritance.
  <li> A <b>dark red</b> arrow indicates private inheritance.
  <li> A <b>purple dashed</b> arrow indicated a "usage" relation, the 
       edge of the arrow is labled with the variable(s) responsible for the
       relation.
       Class \c A uses class \c B, if class \c A has a member variable \c m 
       of type C, where B is a subtype of C (e.g. C could be \c B, \c B*, <code>T\<B\>*</code> ). 
  </ul>


Here are a couple of header files that together show the various diagrams
that doxygen can generate:

\verbinclude diagrams_a.h
<code>diagrams_b.h</code>
\verbinclude diagrams_b.h
<code>diagrams_c.h</code>
\verbinclude diagrams_c.h
<code>diagrams_d.h</code>
\verbinclude diagrams_d.h
<code>diagrams_e.h</code>
\verbinclude diagrams_e.h
