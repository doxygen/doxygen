/*! \page history Doxygen History

<h2>Version 1.2.0</h2>
<h3>Major new features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for RTF output.
<li>Using the dot tool of the AT\&T's GraphViz package, doxygen can now
    generate inheritance diagrams, collaboration diagrams, include
    dependency graphs, included by graphs and graphical inheritance overviews.
<li>Function arguments can now be documented with separate comment blocks.
<li>Initializers and macro definitions are now included in the documentation.
<li>Variables and typedefs are now put in their own section.
<li>Old configuration files can be upgraded using the -u option without
    loosing any changes.
<li>Using the \\if and \\endif commands, doxygen can conditionally 
    include documentation blocks.
<li>Added Doc++ like support for member grouping.
<li>Doxygen now has a GUI front-end called doxywizard (based on Qt-2.1)
<li>All info about configuration options is now concentrated in a new
    tool called configgen. This tool can generate the configuration 
    parser and GUI front-end from source templates. 
<li>Better support for the using keyword.
<li>New transparent mini logo that is put in the footer of all HTML pages.
<li>Internationalization support for the Polish, Portuguese and Croatian language.
<li>Todo list support.
<li>If the source browser is enabled, for a function, a list of function whose
    implementation calls that function, is generated.
<li>All source code fragments are now syntax highlighted in the HTML output.
    The colors can be changed using cascading style sheets.
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.0.0</h2>

<h3>Major new features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for templates and namespaces.
<li>Internationalization support. Currently supported languages are:
    English, Czech, German, Spanish, Finnish, French, Italian, Japanese,
    Dutch, and Swedish. 
<li>Automatic generation of inheritance diagrams for sub and super classes.
<li>Support for man page, compressed HTML help, and hyperlinked PDF output.
<li>Cross-referencing documentation with source code and source inlining.
<li>LaTeX formulas can be included in the documentation.
<li>Support for parsing Corba and Microsoft IDL.
<li>Images can be included in the documentation.
<li>Improved parsing and preprocessing.
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.4</h2>

<h3>Major new features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>LaTeX output generation.
<li>Full JavaDoc support. 
<li>Build-in C-preprocessor for correct conditional parsing of source code
    that is read by Doxygen.
<li>Build-in HTML to LaTeX converter. This allows you to use HTML tags in
    your documentation, while doxygen still generates proper LaTeX output.
<li>Many new commands (there are now more than 60!) to document
    more entities, to make the documentation look nicer, and to include 
    examples or pieces of examples.
<li>Enum types, enum values, typedefs, \#defines, and files can now be 
    documented.
<li>Completely new documentation, that is now generated by Doxygen.
<li>A lot of small examples are now included.
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.3</h2>
<h3>Major new features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A PHP based search engine that allows you to search through the generated 
    documentation.
<li>A configuration file instead of command-line options. A default 
    configuration file can be generated 
    by <a href="doxygen_usage.html">doxygen</a>.
<li>Added an option to generate output for undocumented classes.
<li>Added an option to generate output for private members.
<li>Every page now contains a condensed index page, allowing much faster 
    navigation through the documentation.
<li>Global and member variables can now be documented.
<li>A project name can now given, which will be included in the 
    documentation.
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.2</h2>
<h3>Major new features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blocks of code are now parsed. Function calls and variables are
    replaced by links to their documentation if possible.
<li>Special example documentation block added. This can be used to
    provide cross references between the documentation and some example code.
<li>Documentation blocks can now be placed inside the body of a class.
<li>Documentation blocks with line range may now be created using 
    special <code>//!</code> C++ line comments.
<li>Unrelated members can now be documented. A page containing a
    list of these members is generated.
<li>Added an <code>\\include</code> command to insert blocks of source code
    into the documentation.
<li>Warnings are generated for members that are undocumented.
<li>You can now specify your own HTML headers and footers for the
    generated pages.
<li>Option added to generated indices containing all external classes
    instead of only the used ones.
