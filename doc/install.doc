\addindex installation
\tableofcontents

First go to the 
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org/download.html">download</a> page
to get the latest distribution, if you have not downloaded doxygen already.

\section install_src_unix Compiling from source on UNIX

If you downloaded the source distribution, you need at least the 
following to build the executable:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">GNU</a> tools 
    \c flex, \c bison, \c libiconv and <code>GNU make</code>, and \c strip
    \addindex flex
    \addindex bison
    \addindex libiconv
    \addindex make
    \addindex strip
    \addindex python
<li>In order to generate a \c Makefile for your platform, you need 
    <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">cmake</a> version 2.8.12 or later.
    \addindex cmake
</ul>

To take full advantage of doxygen's features the following additional
tools should be installed.

<ul>
<li>Qt Software's GUI toolkit 
    <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt</A>
    \addindex Qt
    version 4.3 or higher (but currently, Qt 5.x is not yet supported).
    This is needed to build the GUI front-end doxywizard. 
<li>A \LaTeX distribution: for instance
    <a href="http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free">TeX Live</a>
    This is needed for generating \LaTeX, Postscript, and PDF output.
<li><a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">
    the Graph visualization toolkit version 1.8.10 or higher</a>
    Needed for the include dependency graphs, 
    the graphical inheritance graphs, and the collaboration graphs.
    If you compile graphviz yourself, make sure you do include
    freetype support (which requires the freetype library and header files), 
    otherwise the graphs will not render proper text labels.
<li>For formulas in the HTML output (when MathJax is not used)
    or in case you do not wish to use `pdflatex,
    the ghostscript interpreter is needed. You can find it at 
    <a href="http://www.ghostscript.com/">www.ghostscript.com</a>.
</ul>

Compilation is now done by performing the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Unpack the archive, unless you already have done that:
   
        gunzip doxygen-$VERSION.src.tar.gz    # uncompress the archive
        tar xf doxygen-$VERSION.src.tar       # unpack it

<li>Create a build directory (for instance inside the source tree)

        cd doxygen-$VERSION
        mkdir build
	cd build

<li>Run cmake with the makefile generator

        cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..

    <code>cmake</code> tries to determine the platform you use, and will look
    for the requires tools. It will report if something is missing.

    If you have Qt-4.3 or higher installed and want to build the GUI
    front-end, you should enable it as follows:

        cmake -Dbuild_wizard=YES ..

    For an overview of other configuration options use

        cmake -L ..

<li>Compile the program by running make:

        make

    The program should compile without problems and the binaries
    (<code>doxygen</code> and optionally <code>doxywizard</code>)
    should be available in the bin directory within the build directory.

<li>Optional: Generate the user manual.
    
        cmake -Dbuild_doc=YES
        make docs

    To let doxygen generate the HTML and PDF documentation.
    
    The HTML directory within the build directory will now contain the html
    documentation (just point a HTML browser to the file
    <code>index.html</code> in the html directory).
    
</ol>

\section install_bin_unix    Installing the binaries on UNIX

After the compilation of the source code do a <code>make install</code>
to install doxygen. If you downloaded the binary distribution for UNIX,
type:

    ./configure
    make install

Binaries are installed into the directory <code>\<prefix\>/bin</code>.
Use <code>make install_docs</code> to install the
documentation and examples into <code>\<docdir\>/doxygen</code>. 

<code>\<prefix\></code> defaults to <code>/usr/local</code> but can be changed with 
the `--prefix` option of the configure script. 
The default <code>\<docdir\></code> directory is 
<code>\<prefix\>/share/doc/packages</code> and can be changed with
the `--docdir` option of the configure script.

Alternatively, you can also copy the binaries from the <code>bin</code> 
directory manually to some <code>bin</code> directory in your search path.
This is sufficient to use doxygen.

\note You need the GNU install tool for this to work (it is part of
the coreutils package). Other install tools may put the binaries in 
the wrong directory!

If you have a RPM or DEP package, then please follow the 
standard installation procedure that is required for these packages. 

\section install_src_windows Compiling from source on Windows

From version 1.8.10 onwards, build files need to be generated by cmake.
cmake can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org/download/

At the moment only the express version of Visual Studio 2013 is tested,
but other version might also work.

Alternatively, you can compile doxygen 
\ref install_src_unix "the UNIX way" using 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin">Cygwin</a>
or <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>.

The next step is to install modern versions of \c bison and \c flex
(see http://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison. After installation and adding them to
your `path` rename `win_flex.exe` to `flex.exe` and `win_bison.exe` to `bison.exe`)
Furthermore you have to install \c python (version 2.6 or higher, see http://www.python.org).
These packages are needed during the compilation process.

Download doxygen's source tarball and put it somewhere (e.g. use <code>c:\\tools</code>)

Now start a visual studio native command shell (for either x86 or x64) and type
\verbatim
cd c:\tools
tar zxvf doxygen-x.y.z.src.tar.gz
\endverbatim
to unpack the sources (you can obtain \c tar from e.g. http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html).
Alternatively you can use an unpack program, like 7-Zip (see http://www.7-zip.org)
or use the build in unpack feature of modern Windows systems).

Now your environment is setup to generate the required project files for \c doxygen.

cd into the \c doxygen-x.y.z directory, create and cd to a build directory
\verbatim
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013"
\endverbatim

Note that compiling Doxywizard currently requires Qt version 4
(see http://qt-project.org/).

Also read the next section for additional tools you may need to install to run
doxygen with certain features enabled.

\section install_bin_windows Installing the binaries on Windows

Doxygen comes as a self-installing archive, so installation is extremely simple.
Just follow the dialogs.

After installation it is recommended to also download and install GraphViz
(version 2.20 or better is highly recommended). Doxygen can use the \c dot tool 
of the GraphViz package to render nicer diagrams, see the 
\ref cfg_have_dot "HAVE_DOT" option in the configuration file.

If you want to produce compressed HTML files (see \ref 
cfg_generate_htmlhelp "GENERATE_HTMLHELP") in the config file, then 
you need the Microsoft HTML help workshop. 
You can download it from 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21138">Microsoft</a>.

If you want to produce Qt Compressed Help files (see \ref 
cfg_qhg_location "QHG_LOCATION") in the config file, then 
you need qhelpgenerator which is part of Qt. 
You can download Qt from <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">Qt Software Downloads</a>.

In order to generate PDF output or use scientific formulas you will also need to
install <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostscript">Ghostscript</a>. 

For \LaTeX a number of distributions exists. Popular ones that should work with
doxygen are <a href="http://www.miktex.org">MikTex</a> 
and <a href="http://www.tug.org/protext/">proTeXt</a>.

Ghostscript can be <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/">downloaded</a> 
from Sourceforge.

After installing \LaTeX and Ghostscript you'll need to make sure the tools
latex.exe, pdflatex.exe, and gswin32c.exe are present in the search path of a
command box. Follow <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm">these</a>
instructions if you are unsure and run the commands from a command box to verify it works.
