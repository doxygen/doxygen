/*! \page install Installation

\addindex installation
First go to the 
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org/download.html">download</a> page
\latexonly({\tt http://www.doxygen.org/download.html})\endlatexonly
to get the latest distribution, if you did not have it already.

This section is divided into the following sections:
<ul>
<li>\ref install_src_unix  "Compiling from source on Unix"
<li>\ref install_bin_unix  "Installing the binaries on Unix"
<li>\ref unix_problems "Known compilation problems for Unix"
<li>\ref install_src_windows "Compiling from source on Windows"

</ul>

\section install_src_unix    Compiling from source on Unix

If you downloaded the source distribution, you need at least the 
following to build the executable:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">GNU</a> tools 
    flex, bison and make
    \addindex flex
    \addindex bison
    \addindex make
<li>In order to generate a Makefile for your platform, you need 
    <a href="http://www.perl.com/">perl</a>
    \latexonly(see {\tt http://www.perl.com/})\endlatexonly.
    \addindex perl
</ul>

To take full advantage of doxygen's features the following additional
tools should be installed.

<ul>
<li>Troll Tech's GUI toolkit 
    <A HREF="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt.html">Qt</A>
    \latexonly(see {\tt http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt.html})\endlatexonly
    \addindex Qt
    version 3.2 or higher.
    This is needed to build the GUI front-end doxywizard. 
<li>A \f$\mbox{\LaTeX}\f$ distribution: for instance
    <a href="http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free">teTeX 1.0</a>
    \latexonly \\par (see {\tt http://www.tug.org/interest.html\#free})\endlatexonly.
    This is needed for generating LaTeX, Postscript, and PDF output.
<li><a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">
    the Graph visualization toolkit version 1.8.10 or higher</a>
    \latexonly \\par (see {\tt http://www.graphviz.org/})\endlatexonly.
    Needed for the include dependency graphs, 
    the graphical inheritance graphs, and the collaboration graphs.
    If you compile graphviz yourself, make sure you do include
    freetype support (which requires the freetype library and header files), 
    otherwise the graphs will not render proper text labels.
<li>The ghostscript interpreter. To be found at 
    <a href="http://www.ghostscript.com/">www.ghostscript.com</a>.
</ul>

Compilation is now done by performing the following steps:

<ol>
<li> Unpack the archive, unless you already have done that:
   
\verbatim
    gunzip doxygen-$VERSION.src.tar.gz    # uncompress the archive
    tar xf doxygen-$VERSION.src.tar       # unpack it
\endverbatim

<li>Run the configure script:
 
\verbatim
    sh ./configure
\endverbatim

    The script tries to determine the platform you use, the make tool 
    (which \e must be GNU make) and the perl 
    interpreter. It will report what it finds. 

    To override the auto detected platform and compiler you can run
    configure as follows:

\verbatim
    configure --platform platform-type
\endverbatim

    See the <code>PLATFORMS</code> file for a list of possible platform
    options.

    If you have Qt-3.2.x or higher installed and want to build the GUI 
    front-end, you should run the configure script with 
    the <code>--with-doxywizard</code> option:

\verbatim
    configure --with-doxywizard
\endverbatim

    For an overview of other configuration options use

\verbatim
    configure --help
\endverbatim

<li>Compile the program by running make:

\verbatim
    make
\endverbatim

    The program should compile without problems and three binaries 
    (<code>doxygen</code> and <code>doxytag</code>) 
    should be available in the bin directory of the distribution.

<li>Optional: Generate the user manual.
    
\verbatim
    make docs
\endverbatim

    To let doxygen generate the HTML documentation.
    
    \note You will need the stream editor <code>sed</code> for this, 
    but this should be available on any Unix platform.

    The HTML directory of the distribution will now contain the html 
    documentation (just point a HTML browser to the file 
    <code>index.html</code> in the 
    html directory).
    
<li>Optional: Generate a PDF version of the manual
    (you will need <code>pdflatex</code>, <code>makeindex</code>, and
     <code>egrep</code> for this).

\verbatim
    make pdf
\endverbatim

    The PDF manual <code>doxygen_manual.pdf</code> will be located 
    in the latex directory of the distribution. Just 
    view and print it via the acrobat reader. 

</ol>

\section install_bin_unix    Installing the binaries on Unix

    After the compilation of the source code do a <code>make install</code>
    to install doxygen. If you downloaded the binary distribution for Unix,
    type:

\verbatim
    ./configure
    make install
\endverbatim   

    Binaries are installed into the directory <code>\<prefix\>/bin</code>.
    Use <code>make install_docs</code> to install the
    documentation and examples into <code>\<docdir\>/doxygen</code>. 

    <code>\<prefix\></code> defaults to <code>/usr/local</code> but can be changed with 
    the <code>--prefix</code> option of the configure script. 
    The default <code>\<docdir\></code> directory is 
    <code>\<prefix\>/share/doc/packages</code> and can be changed with
    the <code>--docdir</code> option of the configure script.

    Alternatively, you can also copy the binaries from the <code>bin</code> 
    directory manually to some <code>bin</code> directory in your search path.
    This is sufficient to use doxygen.

    \note You need the GNU install tool for this to work (it is part of
    the coreutils package). Other install tools may put the binaries in 
    the wrong directory!

    If you have a RPM or DEP package, then please follow the 
    standard installation procedure that is required for these packages. 

\section unix_problems Known compilation problems for Unix

<b>Qt problems</b>

The Qt include files and libraries are not a subdirectory of the
directory pointed to by QTDIR on some systems
(for instance on Red Hat 6.0 includes are in /usr/include/qt and
libs are in /usr/lib).
  
The solution: go to the root of the doxygen distribution and do:
\verbatim
   mkdir qt
   cd qt
   ln -s your-qt-include-dir-here include
   ln -s your-qt-lib-dir-here lib
   export QTDIR=$PWD
\endverbatim 

If you have a csh-like shell you should use <code>setenv QTDIR \$PWD</code>
instead of the <code>export</code> command above.
  
Now install doxygen as described above.  

<b>Bison problems</b>

Versions 1.31 to 1.34 of bison contain a "bug" that results in a 
compiler errors like this:

ce_parse.cpp:348: member `class CPPValue yyalloc::yyvs' with 
constructor not allowed in union

This problem has been solved in version 1.35 (versions before 1.31 
will also work).

<b>Latex problems</b>

The file <code>a4wide.sty</code> is not available for all distributions. If
your distribution does not have it please select another paper type
in the config file (see the \ref cfg_paper_type "PAPER_TYPE" tag in the 
config file).

<b>HP-UX \& Digital Unix problems</b>

If you are compiling for HP-UX with aCC and you get this error:
\verbatim
    /opt/aCC/lbin/ld: Unsatisfied symbols:
    alloca (code)
\endverbatim
  then you should (according to Anke Selig) edit <code>ce_parse.cpp</code> 
  and replace
\verbatim
    extern "C" {
      void *alloca (unsigned int);
    };
\endverbatim
  with
\verbatim
    #include <alloca.h>  
\endverbatim

  If that does not help, try removing <code>ce_parse.cpp</code> and let 
  bison rebuild it (this worked for me).

If you are compiling for Digital Unix, the same problem can be solved
(according to Barnard Schmallhof) by replacing the following in 
ce_parse.cpp:
   
\verbatim
    #else /* not GNU C.  */
    #if (!defined (__STDC__) && defined (sparc)) || defined (__sparc__) \
        || defined (__sparc) || defined (__sgi)
    #include <alloca.h>
\endverbatim

  with

\verbatim
    #else /* not GNU C.  */
    #if (!defined (__STDC__) && defined (sparc)) || defined (__sparc__) \
        || defined (__sparc) || defined (__sgi) || defined (__osf__)
    #include <alloca.h>
\endverbatim

  Alternatively, one could fix the problem at the bison side.
  Here is patch for bison.simple (provided by Andre Johansen):
 
\verbatim
--- bison.simple~       Tue Nov 18 11:45:53 1997
+++ bison.simple        Mon Jan 26 15:10:26 1998

     || defined (__sparc) || defined (__sgi) || defined (__alpha)

 #else /* not sparc */
 #if defined (MSDOS) && !defined (__TURBOC__)
\endverbatim

  The generated scanner.cpp that comes with doxygen is build with this
  patch applied.  

<b>Sun compiler problems</b>

It appears that doxygen doesn't work properly if it is compiled 
with Sun's C++ WorkShop Compiler. I cannot verify this myself as I do 
not have access to a Solaris machine with this compiler. With GNU compiler
it does work.

when configuring with <code>--static</code> I got:

\verbatim
Undefined                       first referenced
 symbol                             in file
dlclose                             /usr/lib/libc.a(nss_deffinder.o)
dlsym                               /usr/lib/libc.a(nss_deffinder.o)
dlopen                              /usr/lib/libc.a(nss_deffinder.o)
\endverbatim

Manually adding <code>-Bdynamic</code> after the target rule in 
<code>Makefile.doxygen</code> and <code>Makefile.doxytag</code> 
will fix this:

\verbatim
$(TARGET): $(OBJECTS) $(OBJMOC) 
        $(LINK) $(LFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(OBJECTS) $(OBJMOC) $(LIBS) -Bdynamic
\endverbatim

<b>GCC compiler problems</b>

Older versions of the GNU compiler have problems with constant strings
containing characters with character codes larger than 127. Therefore 
the compiler will fail to compile some of the translator_xx.h files. 
A workaround, if you are planning to use the English translation only, 
is to configure doxygen with the <code>--english-only</code> option.  

On some platforms (such as OpenBSD) using some versions of gcc with
-O2 can lead to eating all memory during the compilation of files 
such as config.cpp. As a workaround use --debug as a configure option 
or omit the -O2 for the particular files in the Makefile.

Gcc versions before 2.95 may produce broken binaries due to bugs in 
these compilers. 

<b>Dot problems</b>

Due to a change in the way image maps are generated, older versions
of doxygen (\<=1.2.17) will not work correctly with newer versions of
graphviz (\>=1.8.8). The effect of this incompatibility is that
generated graphs in HTML are not properly clickable. For doxygen 1.3
it is recommended to use at least graphviz 1.8.10 or higher.
For doxygen 1.4.7 or higher it is recommended to 
use GraphViz 2.8 or higher to avoid font issues.

<b>Red Hat 9.0 problems</b>

If you get the following error after running make
\verbatim
tmake error: qtools.pro:70: Syntax error
\endverbatim
then first type
\verbatim
export LANG=
\endverbatim
before running make.

\section install_src_windows Compiling from source on Windows

From version 1.5.0 onwards, build files are provided for Visual Studio 2005.
Also the free "Express" version of Developer Studio can be used to compile doxygen.
Alternatively, you can compile doxygen \ref install_src_unix "the Unix way" using 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin">Cygwin</a>
or <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>.

Before you can compile doxygen you need to download and install the C++ compiler of
Visual Studio. Since Microsoft apparently wants to lure everyone into using their 
.NET stuff, you need to
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/">
do some manual steps</a> in order to setup a proper working environment for building
native win32 applications.

Once your environment is setup, you 
can <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc">download</a> 
the source distribution of doxygen and unpack it. 
If you don't have a tool like WinZip, then I suggest to download 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/">unxutils</a>
and untar the archive from within a command box using
\verbatim
  tar zxvf doxygen-version.src.tar.gz
\endverbatim
Inside the archive you will find a \c winbuild directory containing a \c Doxygen.sln
file. Just open this file in Visual Studio. You can now build the Doxygen, Doxytag,
and Doxywizard projects for Release or Debug to compile the executables. 

Note that compiling Doxywizard currently requires a <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/qt3">
commercial license for Qt 3</a>.

Also read the next section for additional tools you may need to install.

<!--

Currently, I have only compiled doxygen for Windows using Microsoft's 
Visual C++ (version 6.0). For other compilers you may need to edit the 
perl script in <code>wintools/make.pl</code> a bit. 
Let me know what you had to change if you got Doxygen working with another 
compiler. If you have Visual Studio you can also use the .dsw file found in
the <code>wintools</code> directory. Note that this file is not maintained
by me, so it might be outdated a little.

If you have Visual C++ 6.0, and the source distribution, you can easily
build doxygen using the project files in the \c wintools directory. If
you want to build the CVS sources, or want to build from the command line,
or with another compiler, you have to follow the steps below.

Thomas Baust reported that if you have Visual Studio.NET (2003) then 
you should be aware that there is a problem with the _popen() and _pclose() 
implementation, which currently leaks handles, so if you build doxygen with 
it and use the INPUT_FILTER, you will run to risk of crashing Windows! 
The problem is reported to and confirmed by Microsoft so maybe it will 
fixed in the next service pack.

Since Windows comes without all the nice tools that Unix users are
used to, you'll need to install a number of these tools before you can compile 
doxygen for Windows from the command-line.

Here is what is required:
<ul>
<li>An unzip/untar tool like WinZip to unpack the tar source distribution. 
    This can be found at http://www.winzip.com/  

    The good, tested, and free alternative is the <code>tar</code> utility
    supplied with <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">cygwin
    tools</a>. Anyway, the cygwin's flex, bison, and sed are also
    recommended below.

<li>Microsoft Visual C++ (I only tested with version 6.0).
    Use the <code>vcvars32.bat</code> batch file to set the environment 
    variables (if you did not select to do this automatically during 
    installation). 

    Borland C++ or MINGW (see http://www.mingw.org/) are also supported. 

<li>Perl 5.0 or higher for Windows. This can be downloaded from:
    http://www.ActiveState.com/Products/ActivePerl/

<li>The GNU tools flex, bison, and sed.
    To get these working on Windows you should install the 
    <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">cygwin tools</a>
    \latexonly(see {\tt http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/})\endlatexonly
    
    Alternatively, you can also choose to 
    download only a <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/dl/cygwin_tools.zip">small subset</a> 
    \latexonly(see {\tt http://www.doxygen.org/dl/cygwin\_tools.zip})\endlatexonly
    of the cygwin tools that I put together just to compile doxygen.

    As a third alternative one could use the GNUWin32 tools that can be
    found at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ 
    
    Make sure the <code>BISON_SIMPLE</code> environment variable points to the
    location where the files <code>bison.simple</code> and 
    is located. For instance if these file is in
    <code>c:\\tools\\cygwin\\usr\\share</code> then BISON_SIMPLE should 
    be set to <code>c:/tools/cygwin/usr/share/bison.simple</code>

    Also make sure the tools are available from a dos box, by adding 
    the directory they are in to the search path.
    
    For those of you who are very new to cygwin (if you are going to
    install it from scratch), you should notice that there is an
    archive file <code>bootstrap.zip</code> which also contains the
    <code>tar</code> utility (<code>tar.exe</code>), <code>gzip</code>
    utilities, and the <code>cygwin1.dll</code> core. This also means
    that you have the <code>tar</code> in hands from the start. It
    can be used to unpack the tar source distribution instead of
    using WinZip -- as mentioned at the beginning of this list of
    steps.

<li>From Doxygen-1.2.2-20001015 onwards, the distribution includes the part
    of Qt-2.x.y that is needed for to compile doxygen and doxytag,
    The Windows specific part were also created.
    As a result doxygen can be compiled on systems without X11 or the
    commerical version of Qt. 

    For doxywizard, a complete Qt library is 
    still a requirement however. A commercial license to build
    doxywizard with the latest Qt library was kindly donated to me
    by the nice people at <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">TrollTech</a>. 
    See doxygen download page for a link. 
   
<li>If you used WinZip to extract the tar archive it will (apparently) not 
    create empty folders, so you have to add the folders
    <code>objects</code> and <code>bin</code> manually in the root of the 
    distribution before compiling.

</ul>


Compilation is now done by performing the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Open a dos box.
    Make sure all tools (i.e. <code>nmake</code>, <code>latex</code>, 
    <code>gswin32</code>, <code>dvips</code>, <code>sed</code>, 
    <code>flex</code>, <code>bison</code>, <code>cl</code>,
    <code>rm</code>, and <code>perl</code>), are accessible from
    the command-line (add them to the PATH environment variable if
    needed).

    Notice: The use of LaTeX is optional and only needed for compilation
    of the documentation into PostScript or PDF. 
    It is \e not needed for compiling the doxygen's binaries. 
    
<li>Go to the doxygen root dir and type:

\verbatim
    make.bat msvc
\endverbatim

    This should build the executables 
    <code>doxygen.exe</code> and <code>doxytag.exe</code>
    using Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler
    (The compiler should not produce any serious warnings or errors).

    You can use also the <code>bcc</code> argument to build
    executables using the Borland C++ compiler, or
    <code>mingw</code> argument to compile using GNU gcc.

<li>To build the examples, go to the <code>examples</code> subdirectory
    and type:

\verbatim
    nmake
\endverbatim

<li>To generate the doxygen documentation, go to the <code>doc</code> 
    subdirectory and type:

\verbatim
    nmake
\endverbatim

    The generated HTML docs are located in the <code>..\\html</code>
    subdirectory.

    The sources for LaTeX documentation are located in the <code>..\\latex</code>
    subdirectory. From those sources, the DVI, PostScript, and PDF
    documentation can be generated. 
</ol>

-->

\section install_bin_windows Installing the binaries on Windows

Doxygen comes as a self-installing archive, so installation is extremely simple.
Just follow the dialogs.

After installation it is recommended to also download and install GraphViz
(version 2.8 or better is highly recommended). Doxygen can use the \c dot tool 
of the GraphViz package to render nicer diagrams, see the 
\ref cfg_have_dot "HAVE_DOT" option in the configuration file.

If you want to produce compressed HTML files (see \ref 
cfg_generate_htmlhelp "GENERATE_HTMLHELP") in the config file, then 
you need the Microsoft HTML help workshop. 
You can download it from 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/vsconHH1Start.asp">Microsoft</a>.

In order to generate PDF output or use scientific formulas you will also need to
install <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostscript">Ghostscript</a>. 

For LaTeX a number of distributions exists. Popular onces that should work with
doxygen are <a href="http://www.miktex.org">MikTex</a> 
and <a href="http://www.xemtex.org">XemTex</a>.

Ghostscript can be <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/">downloaded</a> 
from Sourceforge.

After installing LaTeX and Ghostscript you'll need to make sure the tools
latex.exe, pdflatex.exe, and gswin32c.exe are present in the search path of a
command box. Follow <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm">these</a>
instructions if you are unsure and run the commands from a command box to verify it works.

<!--
There is no fancy installation procedure at the moment (if anyone can
add it in a location independent way please let me know).

To install doxygen, just copy the binaries from the <code>bin</code> directory
to a location somewhere in the path. Alternatively, you can include 
the <code>bin</code> directory of the distribution to the path.

There are a couple of tools you may want to install to use all of doxygen's
features:

<ul>
<li>To generate LaTeX documentation or formulas in HTML you need the tools:
    <code>latex</code>, <code>dvips</code> and <code>gswin32</code>. 
    To get these working under Windows
    install the fpTeX distribution. You can find more info at:
    http://www.fptex.org/ and download it from CTAN or one of its mirrors.
    In the Netherlands for example this would be: 
    ftp://ftp.easynet.nl/mirror/CTAN/systems/win32/fptex/

    Make sure the tools are available from a dos box, by adding the 
    directory they are in to the search path.

    For your information, the LaTeX is freely available set of so
    called macros and styles on the top of the famous TeX program
    (by famous Donald Knuth) and the accompanied utilities (all
    available for free). It is used for high quality
    typesetting. The result -- in the form of so called
    <code>DVI</code> (DeVice Independent) file -- can be printed or
    displayed on various devices preserving exactly the same look up
    to the capability of the device. The <code>dvips</code> allows you
    to convert the <code>dvi</code> to the high quality PostScript
    (i.e. PostScript that can be processed by utilities like 
    <code>psnup</code>, <code>psbook</code>, <code>psselect</code>,
    and others). The derived version of TeX (the pdfTeX) can be used
    to produce PDF output instead of DVI, or the PDF can be produced
    from PostScript using the utility <code>ps2pdf</code>.

    If you want to use MikTeX then you need to select at least the 
    medium size installation. For really old versions of MikTex or minimal 
    installations, you may need to download the fancyhdr package separately. 
    You can find it in the 
    <a href="ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/fancyhdr/">
    contrib/supported</a> directory of the tex archives.

<li>If you want to generate compressed HTML help 
    (see \ref cfg_generate_htmlhelp "GENERATE_HTMLHELP") in the 
    config file, then you need the Microsoft HTML help workshop. 
    You can download it from 
    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/vsconHH1Start.asp">Microsoft</a>.

<li><a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">
    the Graph visualization toolkit version 1.8.10</a><br>
    \latexonly(see {\tt http://www.graphviz.org/})\endlatexonly.
    Needed for the include dependency graphs, the graphical inheritance graphs,
    and the collaboration graphs.
</ul>
