\section config_format Format

A configuration file is a free-form ASCII text file with a structure
that is similar to that of a \c Makefile, with the default name \c Doxyfile. It is
parsed by \c doxygen. The file may contain tabs and newlines for
formatting purposes. The statements in the file are case-sensitive.
Comments may be placed anywhere within the file (except within quotes).
Comments beginning with two hash characters (\c \#\#) are kept when updating
the configuration file and are placed in front of the TAG are in front of.
Comments beginning with two hash characters (\c \#\#) at the end of the
configuration file are also kept and placed at the end of the file.
Comments begin with the hash character (\c \#) and ends at the end of the line.

The file essentially consists of a list of assignment statements.
Each statement consists of a \c TAG_NAME written in capitals,
followed by the equal sign (<code>=</code>) and one or more values. If the same tag
is assigned more than once, the last assignment overwrites any earlier
assignment. For tags that take a list as their argument,
the <code>+=</code> operator can be used instead of <code>=</code> to append 
new values to the list. Values are sequences of non-blanks. If the value should 
contain one or more blanks it must be surrounded by quotes (<code>&quot;...&quot;</code>).
Multiple lines can be concatenated by inserting a backslash (\c \\)
as the last character of a line. Environment variables can be expanded 
using the pattern <code>\$(ENV_VARIABLE_NAME)</code>.

You can also include part of a configuration file from another configuration
file using a <code>\@INCLUDE</code> tag as follows:
\verbatim
@INCLUDE = config_file_name
\endverbatim 
The include file is searched in the current working directory. You can 
also specify a list of directories that should be searched before looking
in the current working directory. Do this by putting a <code>\@INCLUDE_PATH</code> tag 
with these paths before the <code>\@INCLUDE</code> tag, e.g.:
\verbatim
@INCLUDE_PATH = my_config_dir
\endverbatim

The configuration options can be divided into several categories.
Below is an alphabetical index of the tags that are recognized 
followed by the descriptions of the tags grouped by category.

      <![CDATA[
This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
<br>
All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed
in front of the TAG it is preceding.<br>
All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
The format is:
\verbatim
      TAG = value [value, ...]
\endverbatim
For lists, items can also be appended using:
\verbatim
      TAG += value [value, ...]
\endverbatim
Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

\section config_examples Examples

Suppose you have a simple project consisting of two files: a source file 
\c example.cc and a header file \c example.h.
Then a minimal configuration file is as simple as:
\verbatim
INPUT            = example.cc example.h
\endverbatim

Assuming the example makes use of Qt classes and \c perl is located 
in <code>/usr/bin</code>, a more realistic configuration file would be:
\verbatim
PROJECT_NAME     = Example
INPUT            = example.cc example.h
WARNINGS         = YES
TAGFILES         = qt.tag
PERL_PATH        = /usr/local/bin/perl
SEARCHENGINE     = NO
\endverbatim

To generate the documentation for the 
<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/qdbttabular/index.html">QdbtTabular</a> package
I have used the following configuration file:
\verbatim
PROJECT_NAME     = QdbtTabular
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = html
WARNINGS         = YES
INPUT            = examples/examples.doc src
FILE_PATTERNS    = *.cc *.h
INCLUDE_PATH     = examples
TAGFILES         = qt.tag
PERL_PATH        = /usr/bin/perl
SEARCHENGINE     = YES
\endverbatim

To regenerate the Qt-1.44 documentation from the sources, you could use the
following config file:
\verbatim
PROJECT_NAME         = Qt
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY     = qt_docs
HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS   = YES
HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES   = YES
ENABLE_PREPROCESSING = YES

                       QIntDictIteratorT:=QIntDictIterator \

INCLUDE_PATH         = $(QTDIR)/include 
RECURSIVE            = YES
\endverbatim

For the Qt-2.1 sources I recommend to use the following settings:
\verbatim
PROJECT_NAME          = Qt
PROJECT_NUMBER        = 2.1
HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS    = YES
HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES    = YES

                        Q_ENUMS(x)= \
                        "QT_STATIC_CONST=static const " \
                        _WS_X11_ \
                        INCLUDE_MENUITEM_DEF
EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF    = YES
EXPAND_AS_DEFINED     = Q_OBJECT_FAKE Q_OBJECT ACTIVATE_SIGNAL_WITH_PARAM \
                        Q_VARIANT_AS
\endverbatim

Here doxygen's preprocessor is used to substitute some
macro names that are normally substituted by the C preprocessor,
but without doing full macro expansion.

 If the \c CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to \c YES, then doxygen will create
 4096 sub-directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output 
 format and will distribute the generated files over these directories. 
 Enabling this option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of source
 files, where putting all generated files in the same directory would otherwise
 causes performance problems for the file system.

      <docs>
<![CDATA[
 Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it parses.
 With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given extension.
 Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it using this tag.
 The format is <code>ext=language</code>, where \c ext is a file extension, and language is one of
 the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, Javascript, C#, C, C++, D, PHP,
 Objective-C, Python, Fortran, VHDL. 

 For instance to make doxygen treat
 <code>.inc</code> files as Fortran files (default is PHP), and <code>.f</code> files as C (default is Fortran),
 use: `inc=Fortran f=C`.

 <br>Note For files without extension you can use `no_extension` as a placeholder.
 <br>Note that for custom extensions you also need to set \ref cfg_file_patterns "FILE_PATTERNS" otherwise the 
 files are not read by doxygen.

 If the \c MARKDOWN_SUPPORT tag is enabled then doxygen pre-processes all 
 comments according to the Markdown format, which allows for more readable 
 documentation. See http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ for details. 
 The output of markdown processing is further processed by doxygen, so you 
 can mix doxygen, HTML, and XML commands with Markdown formatting. 
 Disable only in case of backward compatibilities issues.

 If you use STL classes (i.e. `std::string`, `std::vector`, etc.) but do not want to
 include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should
 set this tag to \c YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
 definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. `func(std::string`); versus
 `func(std::string) {}`). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
 diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.

<![CDATA[
 The size of the symbol lookup cache can be 
 set using \c LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE. This cache is used to resolve symbols given 
 their name and scope. Since this can be an expensive process and often the 
 same symbol appears multiple times in the code, doxygen keeps a cache of 
 pre-resolved symbols. If the cache is too small doxygen will become slower. 
 If the cache is too large, memory is wasted. The cache size is given by this 
 formula: \f$2^{(16+\mbox{LOOKUP\_CACHE\_SIZE})}\f$. The valid range is 0..9, the default is 0, 
 corresponding to a cache size of \f$2^{16} = 65536\f$ symbols. 
 At the end of a run doxygen will report the cache usage and suggest the
 optimal cache size from a speed point of view.

 tagging system (see http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html). You 
 will need version 4.8.6 or higher. 
<br>
 To use it do the following:
 -# Install the latest version of \c global
 -# Enable \ref cfg_source_browser "SOURCE_BROWSER" and \c USE_HTAGS in the config file
 -# Make sure the \ref cfg_input "INPUT" points to the root of the source tree
 -# Run \c doxygen as normal
<br>
 Doxygen will invoke \c htags (and that will in turn invoke \c gtags), so these tools
 must be available from the command line (i.e. in the search path).

 The result: instead of the source browser generated by doxygen, the links to
 source code will now point to the output of \c htags.

 The \c HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE tag controls the color of the HTML output. 
 Doxygen will adjust the colors in the stylesheet and background images 
 according to this color. Hue is specified as an angle on a colorwheel, 
 see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue for more information. 
 For instance the value 0 represents red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 
 180 is cyan, 240 is blue, 300 purple, and 360 is red again.

 The \c DISABLE_INDEX tag can be used to turn on/off the condensed index (tabs) at

<![CDATA[
 The \c GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
 structure should be generated to display hierarchical information.
 If the tag value is set to \c YES, a side panel will be generated
 containing a tree-like index structure (just like the one that
 is generated for HTML Help). For this to work a browser that supports
 JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required (i.e. any modern browser).
 Windows users are probably better off using the HTML help feature.

 Via custom stylesheets (see \ref cfg_html_extra_stylesheet "HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET")
 one can further \ref doxygen_finetune "fine-tune" the look of the index.
 As an example, the default style sheet generated by doxygen has an
 example that shows how to put an image at the root of the tree instead of
 the \ref cfg_project_name "PROJECT_NAME".

 Since the tree basically has the same information as the tab index, you could
 consider setting \ref cfg_disable_index "DISABLE_INDEX" to \c YES when 
 enabling this option.

 When the \c SEARCHENGINE tag is enabled doxygen will generate a search box

 HTML help (\ref cfg_generate_htmlhelp "GENERATE_HTMLHELP"),

 function so this one should typically be disabled. For large projects 
 the javascript based search engine can be slow, then enabling 
 \ref cfg_server_based_search "SERVER_BASED_SEARCH" may provide a 
 better solution. 

 It is possible to search using the keyboard;
 to jump to the search box use <code>\<access key\> + S</code> (what the <code>\<access key\></code> is
 depends on the OS and browser, but it is typically <code>\<CTRL\></code>, <code>\<ALT\></code>/<code>\<option\></code>, or both).
 Inside the search box use the <code>\<cursor down key\></code> to jump into the search 
 results window, the results can be navigated using the <code>\<cursor keys\></code>.
 Press <code>\<Enter\></code> to select an item or <code>\<escape\></code> to cancel the search. The

format of a tag file without this location is as follows: 
\verbatim
  TAGFILES = file1 file2 ... 
\endverbatim
Adding location for the tag files is done as follows: 
\verbatim
  TAGFILES = file1=loc1 "file2 = loc2" ... 
\endverbatim
where `loc1` and `loc2` can be relative or absolute paths or URLs.
 See the section \ref external for more information about the use of tag files.

 \note
  Each tag file must have an unique name 
  (where the name does \e NOT include the path).
  If a tag file is not located in the directory in which doxygen 
  is run, you must also specify the path to the tagfile here.
