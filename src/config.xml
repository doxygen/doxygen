    <option type='string' id='DOXYFILE_ENCODING' format='string' docs='
This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file 
that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all 
text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the 
iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See 
http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv for the list of possible encodings. 
' defval='UTF-8'/>
    <option type='string' id='PROJECT_NAME' format='string' docs='
The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
by quotes) that should identify the project. ' defval=''/>
    <option type='string' id='PROJECT_NUMBER' format='string' docs='
The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. 
This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or 
if some version control system is used. 
' defval=''/>
    <option type='string' id='PROJECT_BRIEF' format='string' docs='
Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description 
for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer 
a quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short. 
' defval=''/>
    <option type='string' id='PROJECT_LOGO' format='file' docs='
With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify an logo or icon that is 
included in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not 
exceed 55 pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. 
Doxygen will copy the logo to the output directory.
' defval=''/>
    <option type='string' id='OUTPUT_DIRECTORY' format='dir' docs='
The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) 
base path where the generated documentation will be put. 
If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location 
where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used. 
' defval=''/>
    <option type='bool' id='CREATE_SUBDIRS' docs='
If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES, then doxygen will create 
4096 sub-directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output 
format and will distribute the generated files over these directories. 
Enabling this option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of 
source files, where putting all generated files in the same directory would 
otherwise cause performance problems for the file system. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='enum' id='OUTPUT_LANGUAGE' defval='English' docs='
The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all 
documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this 
information to generate all constant output in the proper language. 
The default language is English, other supported languages are: 
Afrikaans, Arabic, Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese, Chinese-Traditional, 
Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, 
Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Japanese-en (Japanese with English 
messages), Korean, Korean-en, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Macedonian, Persian, 
Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Serbian-Cyrillic, Slovak, 
Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.

the file and class documentation (similar to JavaDoc). 
Set to NO to disable this. 
' defval='1'/>

This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator 
that is used to form the text in various listings. Each string 
in this list, if found as the leading text of the brief description, will be 
stripped from the text and the result after processing the whole list, is 
used as the annotated text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. 
If left blank, the following values are used (&quot;$name&quot; is automatically 
replaced with the name of the entity): &quot;The $name class&quot; &quot;The $name widget&quot;

Doxygen will generate a detailed section even if there is only a brief 
description. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB' docs='
If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all 
inherited members of a class in the documentation of that class as if those 
members were ordinary class members. Constructors, destructors and assignment 
operators of the base classes will not be shown. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='FULL_PATH_NAMES' docs='
If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then Doxygen will prepend the full 
path before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set 
to NO the shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used. 
' defval='1'/>
    <option type='list' id='STRIP_FROM_PATH' format='string' docs='
If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then the STRIP_FROM_PATH tag 
can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path. Stripping is 
only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part of 
the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list. 
If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the 
path to strip. 
' depends='FULL_PATH_NAMES'>
      <value name=''/>
    </option>
    <option type='list' id='STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH' format='string' docs='
The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of 
the path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells 
the reader which header file to include in order to use a class. 
If left blank only the name of the header file containing the class 
definition is used. Otherwise one should specify the include paths that 
are normally passed to the compiler using the -I flag. 
'>
    </option>
    <option type='bool' id='SHORT_NAMES' docs='
If the SHORT_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate much shorter 
(but less readable) file names. This can be useful if your file system 
doesn&apos;t support long names like on DOS, Mac, or CD-ROM. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF' docs='
If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen 
will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style 
comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the JavaDoc 
comments will behave just like regular Qt-style comments 
(thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief description.) 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='QT_AUTOBRIEF' docs='
If the QT_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen will 
interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a Qt-style 
comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the comments 
will behave just like regular Qt-style comments (thus requiring 
an explicit \brief command for a brief description.) 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF' docs='
The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make Doxygen 
treat a multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or /// 
comments) as a brief description. This used to be the default behaviour. 
The new default is to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed 
description. Set this tag to YES if you prefer the old behaviour instead. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='INHERIT_DOCS' docs='
If the INHERIT_DOCS tag is set to YES (the default) then an undocumented 
member inherits the documentation from any documented member that it 
re-implements. 
' defval='1'/>
    <option type='bool' id='SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES' docs='
If the SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES tag is set to YES, then doxygen will produce 
a new page for each member. If set to NO, the documentation of a member will 
be part of the file/class/namespace that contains it. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='int' id='TAB_SIZE' docs='
The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. 
Doxygen uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments. 
' minval='1' maxval='16' defval='8'/>
    <option type='list' id='ALIASES' format='string' docs='
This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that acts 
as commands in the documentation. An alias has the form &quot;name=value&quot;. 
For example adding &quot;sideeffect=\par Side Effects:\n&quot; will allow you to 
put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the documentation, which 
will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading &quot;Side Effects:&quot;. 
You can put \n&apos;s in the value part of an alias to insert newlines. 
'>
    </option>
    <option type='bool' id='OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C' docs='
Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C 
sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. 
For instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list 
of all members will be omitted, etc. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA' docs='
Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA tag to YES if your project consists of Java 
sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for 
Java. For instance, namespaces will be presented as packages, qualified 
scopes will look different, etc. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='OPTIMIZE_FOR_FORTRAN' docs='
Set the OPTIMIZE_FOR_FORTRAN tag to YES if your project consists of Fortran 
sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for 
Fortran. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_VHDL' docs='
Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_VHDL tag to YES if your project consists of VHDL 
sources. Doxygen will then generate output that is tailored for 
VHDL. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='list' id='EXTENSION_MAPPING' format='string' docs='
Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it 
parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given extension. 
Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it using this 
tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and language 
is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, Javascript, CSharp, C, 
C++, D, PHP, Objective-C, Python, Fortran, VHDL, C, C++. For instance to make 
doxygen treat .inc files as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C 
(default is Fortran), use: inc=Fortran f=C. Note that for custom extensions 
you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise the files are not read by doxygen.
'>
    </option>
    <option type='bool' id='BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT' docs='
If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want 
to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should 
set this tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and 
definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string); v.s. 
func(std::string) {}). This also makes the inheritance and collaboration 
diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='CPP_CLI_SUPPORT' docs='
If you use Microsoft&apos;s C++/CLI language, you should set this option to YES to 
enable parsing support. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='SIP_SUPPORT' docs='
Set the SIP_SUPPORT tag to YES if your project consists of sip sources only. 
Doxygen will parse them like normal C++ but will assume all classes use public 
instead of private inheritance when no explicit protection keyword is present. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='IDL_PROPERTY_SUPPORT' docs='
For Microsoft&apos;s IDL there are propget and propput attributes to indicate getter 
and setter methods for a property. Setting this option to YES (the default) 
will make doxygen replace the get and set methods by a property in the 
documentation. This will only work if the methods are indeed getting or 
setting a simple type. If this is not the case, or you want to show the 
methods anyway, you should set this option to NO. 
' defval='1'/>
    <option type='bool' id='DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC' docs='
If member grouping is used in the documentation and the DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC 
tag is set to YES, then doxygen will reuse the documentation of the first 
member in the group (if any) for the other members of the group. By default 
all members of a group must be documented explicitly. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='SUBGROUPING' docs='
Set the SUBGROUPING tag to YES (the default) to allow class member groups of 
the same type (for instance a group of public functions) to be put as a 
subgroup of that type (e.g. under the Public Functions section). Set it to 
NO to prevent subgrouping. Alternatively, this can be done per class using 
the \nosubgrouping command. 
' defval='1'/>
    <option type='bool' id='INLINE_GROUPED_CLASSES' docs='
When the INLINE_GROUPED_CLASSES tag is set to YES, classes, structs and 
unions are shown inside the group in which they are included (e.g. using 
@ingroup) instead of on a separate page (for HTML and Man pages) or 
section (for LaTeX and RTF).
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='bool' id='TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT' docs='
When TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT is enabled, a typedef of a struct, union, or enum 
is documented as struct, union, or enum with the name of the typedef. So 
typedef struct TypeS {} TypeT, will appear in the documentation as a struct 
with name TypeT. When disabled the typedef will appear as a member of a file, 
namespace, or class. And the struct will be named TypeS. This can typically 
be useful for C code in case the coding convention dictates that all compound 
types are typedef&apos;ed and only the typedef is referenced, never the tag name. 
' defval='0'/>
    <option type='int' id='SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE' docs='
The SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE determines the size of the internal cache use to 
determine which symbols to keep in memory and which to flush to disk. 
When the cache is full, less often used symbols will be written to disk. 
For small to medium size projects (&lt;1000 input files) the default value is 
probably good enough. For larger projects a too small cache size can cause 
doxygen to be busy swapping symbols to and from disk most of the time 
causing a significant performance penalty. 
If the system has enough physical memory increasing the cache will improve the 
performance by keeping more symbols in memory. Note that the value works on 
a logarithmic scale so increasing the size by one will roughly double the 
memory usage. The cache size is given by this formula: 
2^(16+SYMBOL_CACHE_SIZE). The valid range is 0..9, the default is 0, 
corresponding to a cache size of 2^16 = 65536 symbols

menu in Eclipse, the contents of the directory containing the HTML and XML 
files needs to be copied into the plugins directory of eclipse. The name of 
the directory within the plugins directory should be the same as 
the ECLIPSE_DOC_ID value. After copying Eclipse needs to be restarted before 
the help appears.

the value YES disables it. 
' defval='0' depends='GENERATE_HTML'/>
    <option type='int' id='ENUM_VALUES_PER_LINE' docs='
The ENUM_VALUES_PER_LINE tag can be used to set the number of enum values

documentation. Note that a value of 0 will completely suppress the enum 
values from appearing in the overview section.

    <option type='bool' id='GENERATE_TREEVIEW' defval='0' docs='
The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index 
structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. 
If the tag value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated 
containing a tree-like index structure (just like the one that 
is generated for HTML Help). For this to work a browser that supports 
JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required (i.e. any modern browser). 
Windows users are probably better off using the HTML help feature.
' depends='GENERATE_HTML'/>
    <option type='bool' id='USE_INLINE_TREES' defval='0' docs='
By enabling USE_INLINE_TREES, doxygen will generate the Groups, Directories,

' depends='GENERATE_HTML'/>
    <option type='int' id='TREEVIEW_WIDTH' docs='
If the treeview is enabled (see GENERATE_TREEVIEW) then this tag can be

links to external symbols imported via tag files in a separate window. 
' depends='GENERATE_HTML'/>
    <option type='int' id='FORMULA_FONTSIZE' docs='
Use this tag to change the font size of Latex formulas included 
as images in the HTML documentation. The default is 10. Note that 
when you change the font size after a successful doxygen run you need 
to manually remove any form_*.png images from the HTML output directory 
to force them to be regenerated. 
' minval='8' maxval='50' defval='10' depends='GENERATE_HTML'/>
    <option type='bool' id='FORMULA_TRANSPARENT' docs='
Use the FORMULA_TRANPARENT tag to determine whether or not the images 
generated for formulas are transparent PNGs. Transparent PNGs are 
not supported properly for IE 6.0, but are supported on all modern browsers. 
Note that when changing this option you need to delete any form_*.png files 
in the HTML output before the changes have effect. 
' defval='1' depends='GENERATE_HTML'/>
    <option type='bool' id='USE_MATHJAX' docs='
Enable the USE_MATHJAX option to render LaTeX formulas using MathJax 
(see http://www.mathjax.org) which uses client side Javascript for the 
rendering instead of using prerendered bitmaps. Use this if you do not 
have LaTeX installed or if you want to formulas look prettier in the HTML 
output. When enabled you also need to install MathJax separately and 
configure the path to it using the MATHJAX_RELPATH option.
' defval='0'/> 
    <option type='string' id='MATHJAX_RELPATH' docs=' 
When MathJax is enabled you need to specify the location relative to the 
HTML output directory using the MATHJAX_RELPATH option. The destination 
directory should contain the MathJax.js script. For instance, if the mathjax 
directory is located at the same level as the HTML output directory, then 
MATHJAX_RELPATH should be ../mathjax. The default value points to the 
mathjax.org site, so you can quickly see the result without installing 
MathJax, but it is strongly recommended to install a local copy of MathJax 
before deployment.
' defval='http://www.mathjax.org/mathjax'/>
    <option type='bool' id='SEARCHENGINE' docs='
When the SEARCHENGINE tag is enabled doxygen will generate a search box 
for the HTML output. The underlying search engine uses javascript 
and DHTML and should work on any modern browser. Note that when using 
HTML help (GENERATE_HTMLHELP), Qt help (GENERATE_QHP), or docsets 
(GENERATE_DOCSET) there is already a search function so this one should 
typically be disabled. For large projects the javascript based search engine 
can be slow, then enabling SERVER_BASED_SEARCH may provide a better solution.
' defval='1' depends='GENERATE_HTML'/>
    <option type='bool' id='SERVER_BASED_SEARCH' docs='
When the SERVER_BASED_SEARCH tag is enabled the search engine will be 
implemented using a PHP enabled web server instead of at the web client 
using Javascript. Doxygen will generate the search PHP script and index 
file to put on the web server. The advantage of the server 
based approach is that it scales better to large projects and allows 
full text search. The disadvantages are that it is more difficult to setup 
and does not have live searching capabilities.

If the CALL_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT options are set to YES then 
doxygen will generate a call dependency graph for every global function 
or class method. Note that enabling this option will significantly increase 
the time of a run. So in most cases it will be better to enable call graphs 
for selected functions only using the \callgraph command. 
' defval='0' depends='HAVE_DOT'/>
    <option type='bool' id='CALLER_GRAPH' docs='
If the CALLER_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then 
doxygen will generate a caller dependency graph for every global function 
or class method. Note that enabling this option will significantly increase 
the time of a run. So in most cases it will be better to enable caller 
graphs for selected functions only using the \callergraph command. 
' defval='0' depends='HAVE_DOT'/>
    <option type='bool' id='GRAPHICAL_HIERARCHY' docs='
If the GRAPHICAL_HIERARCHY and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen 
will generate a graphical hierarchy of all classes instead of a textual one. 
' defval='1' depends='HAVE_DOT'/>
    <option type='bool' id='DIRECTORY_GRAPH' docs='
If the DIRECTORY_GRAPH, SHOW_DIRECTORIES and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES 
then doxygen will show the dependencies a directory has on other directories 
in a graphical way. The dependency relations are determined by the #include 
relations between the files in the directories. 
' defval='1' depends='HAVE_DOT'/>
    <option type='enum' id='DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT' defval='png' docs='
The DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT tag can be used to set the image format of the images 
generated by dot. Possible values are svg, png, jpg, or gif. 
If left blank png will be used. 
' depends='HAVE_DOT'>
      <value name='png'/>
      <value name='jpg'/>
      <value name='gif'/>
      <value name='svg'/>
    </option>
    <option type='string' id='DOT_PATH' format='dir' docs='
The tag DOT_PATH can be used to specify the path where the dot tool can be 
found. If left blank, it is assumed the dot tool can be found in the path. 
' defval='' depends='HAVE_DOT'/>
    <option type='list' id='DOTFILE_DIRS' format='dir' docs='
The DOTFILE_DIRS tag can be used to specify one or more directories that 
contain dot files that are included in the documentation (see the 
\dotfile command). 
' depends='HAVE_DOT'>
    </option>
    <option type='list' id='MSCFILE_DIRS' format='dir' docs='
The MSCFILE_DIRS tag can be used to specify one or more directories that 
contain msc files that are included in the documentation (see the 
\mscfile command).

    </option>
    <option type='int' id='DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES' docs='
The DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES tag can be used to set the maximum number of 
nodes that will be shown in the graph. If the number of nodes in a graph 
becomes larger than this value, doxygen will truncate the graph, which is 
visualized by representing a node as a red box. Note that doxygen if the 
number of direct children of the root node in a graph is already larger than 
DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES then the graph will not be shown at all. Also note 
that the size of a graph can be further restricted by MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH. 
' minval='0' maxval='10000' defval='50' depends='HAVE_DOT'/>
    <option type='int' id='MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH' docs='
The MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH tag can be used to set the maximum depth of the 
graphs generated by dot. A depth value of 3 means that only nodes reachable 
from the root by following a path via at most 3 edges will be shown. Nodes 
that lay further from the root node will be omitted. Note that setting this 
option to 1 or 2 may greatly reduce the computation time needed for large 
code bases. Also note that the size of a graph can be further restricted by 
DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES. Using a depth of 0 means no depth restriction. 
' minval='0' maxval='1000' defval='0' depends='HAVE_DOT'/>
    <option type='bool' id='DOT_TRANSPARENT' docs='
Set the DOT_TRANSPARENT tag to YES to generate images with a transparent 
background. This is disabled by default, because dot on Windows does not 
seem to support this out of the box. Warning: Depending on the platform used, 
enabling this option may lead to badly anti-aliased labels on the edges of 
a graph (i.e. they become hard to read). 
' defval='0' depends='HAVE_DOT'/>
    <option type='bool' id='DOT_MULTI_TARGETS' docs='
Set the DOT_MULTI_TARGETS tag to YES allow dot to generate multiple output 
files in one run (i.e. multiple -o and -T options on the command line). This 
makes dot run faster, but since only newer versions of dot (&gt;1.8.10) 
support this, this feature is disabled by default. 
' defval='0' depends='HAVE_DOT'/>
    <option type='bool' id='GENERATE_LEGEND' docs='
If the GENERATE_LEGEND tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will 
generate a legend page explaining the meaning of the various boxes and 
arrows in the dot generated graphs. 
' defval='1' depends='HAVE_DOT'/>
    <option type='bool' id='DOT_CLEANUP' docs='
If the DOT_CLEANUP tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will 
remove the intermediate dot files that are used to generate 
the various graphs.
