This directory contains an example of how to use doxygen as
an "source parsing engine" in an application. It shows how to configure doxygen
from the application and shows how to run doxygen without generating output.
Practically, it allows you to extract the symbols found in the source code.

Note that if you use this approach your application should be licensed under the GPL.
