 * A brief history of JavaDoc-style (C-style) banner comments.
 *
 * This is the typical JavaDoc-style C-style "banner" comment. It starts with
 * a forward slash followed by some number, n, of asterisks, where n > 2. It's
 * written this way to be more "visible" to developers who are reading the
 * source code.
 *
 * Often, developers are unaware that this is not (by default) a valid Doxygen
 * comment block!
 *
 * However, as long as JAVADOC_BLOCK = YES is added to the Doxyfile, it will
 * work as expected.
 *
 * This style of commenting behaves well with clang-format.
